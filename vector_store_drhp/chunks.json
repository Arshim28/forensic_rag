Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, expectations, and assumptions about us that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the relevant forward-looking statement.

There can be no assurance to investors that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements will prove to be correct.

For further details, see \"Outstanding Litigation and Other Material Developments\" on page 479.\n\n# Risk factors \n\nThe following is a summary of the top 10 risk factors in relation to our Company:\n\n1. Our revenues and operations are dependent upon technology. Failure of these technologies, failure to upgrade or innovate these technologies or failure to identify and develop new technologies could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our products may be displaced by newer technology and any inability or failure to adapt to technological developments, the evolving competitive landscape or industry trends could harm our business and competitiveness.\n2. We derive a significant part of our revenue from our top 10 customers and we do not have long term contracts with most of these customers. If one or more of such customers choose not to source their requirements from us or to terminate our long-term contracts, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\n3. Our business has grown rapidly, including our revenue from operations that has grown at a CAGR of $15.13 \\%$ from \u20b94,967.34 million in Fiscal 2022 to \u20b96,583.92 million in Fiscal 2024, and we may fail to manage our growth effectively.\n4. We have working capital and capital expenditure / investment requirements, and may require additional financing to meet those requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n5. Orders in our order book may be delayed, modified or cancelled, which may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\n6. The success of our business operations is dependent on our key managerial personnel, including our senior management as well as our ability to attract, train and retain such employees. If we lose key members of our management team or are unable to attract and retain executives, key personnel and employees we need to support our operations and growth, our business and future growth prospects may be harmed.\n7. Under-utilization of our manufacturing and installed waste treatment capacities, and an inability to effectively utilize our current capacities could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects and future financial performance.\n8. Failure by third parties to supply, manufacture or deliver materials and components according to schedules, prices, quality, and volumes that are acceptable to us, or our inability to manage these materials and parts effectively may lead to delays in delivery of technology solutions to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business, sales, and our ability to retain and expand our base of customers.\n9. The SWT projects we operate have been awarded primarily through competitive bidding process and our bids may not always be accepted. We may not be able to qualify for, compete and win projects, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, our ability to negotiate the standard form of contracts for our projects may be limited and certain unusual or onerous provisions may be imposed on us, which may restrict our flexibility in undertaking our business and thereby affect the efficient execution and profitability of our projects.\n10. We have had negative cash flows from operating activities in the past and may continue to have negative cash flows in the future.\n\nInvestors are advised to carefully read \"Risk Factors\" on page 44 to have an informed view before making an investment decision in the Offer.\n\n## Summary of contingent liabilities\n\nA summary table of contingent liabilities as per Ind AS 37, as derived from the Restated Consolidated Financial Information, is set forth below:\n\n| S. <br> No. | Particulars | Amount |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  | June 30, <br> 2024 | June 30, <br> 2023 | March <br> 31, 2024 | March <br> 31, 2023 | March <br> 31, 2022 |\n| 1. | Customs notice -

Prospective investors should carefully consider all the information in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, including the risks and uncertainties described below, before making an investment in the Equity Shares. The risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the only risks that we currently face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on our business. If any or a combination of the following risks, or other risks that are not currently known or are now deemed immaterial, actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could suffer, the price of our Equity Shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\n\nThe financial and other related implications of the risks concerned, wherever quantifiable, have been disclosed in the risk factors mentioned below. However, there are risks where the effect is not quantifiable and hence have not been disclosed in the applicable risk factors. Prospective investors should read this section together with \"Our Business\", \"Industry Overview\" and \"Management's Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" on pages 253, 181 and 447, respectively, as well as the other financial and statistical information contained in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. In making an investment decision, prospective investors are required to rely on their own examination of us and the terms of the Offer, including the merits and risks involved. You should consult your tax, financial and legal advisors about the particular consequences to you of an investment in our Equity Shares. Potential investors should pay particular attention to the fact that our Company is incorporated under the laws of India and is subject to legal and regulatory environment which may differ in certain respects from that of other countries.\n\nThis Draft Red Herring Prospectus also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties where actual results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. For further details, see \"Forward-Looking Statements\" on page 27.\n\nUnless the context requires otherwise, the financial information used in this section is derived from our Restated Consolidated Financial Information on page 334. Our fiscal year ends on March 31 of each year, and references to a particular fiscal are to the twelve months ended March 31 of that year.\n\nThe industry information contained in this section is derived from the industry report titled \"Industry Report on Indian STP, MSW Management, and Biogas Market\" dated November 30, 2024, which is exclusively prepared for the purposes of the Offer and issued by Frost \\& Sullivan and is commissioned and paid for by our Company (\"F\\&S Report\"). Frost \\& Sullivan was appointed on pursuant to engagement letter dated February 28, 2024. We commissioned and paid for the F\\&S Report for the purposes of confirming our understanding of the industry specifically for the purposes of the Offer. The F\\&S Report is available on the website of our Company at https://sfcenvironment.com/investors/financial-highlights/industry-report.

Frost and Sullivan is not, and has not in the past, been engaged or interested in the formation, or promotion, or management of our Company. Further, it is an independent agency and neither our Company, nor our Promoters, Directors, Key Managerial Personnel, Senior Management, Promoters and Subsidiaries, nor the BRLMs are a related party to Frost and Sullivan as per the definition of \"related party\" under the Companies Act, 2013 and the SEBI Listing Regulations. For details, see \"Certain Conventions, Use of Financial Information and Market Data and Currency of Presentation - Industry and Market Data\" on page 24.\n\n## Internal Risk Factors\n\n1. Our revenues and operations are dependent upon technology. Failure of these technologies, failure to upgrade or innovate these technologies or failure to identify and develop new technologies could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our products may be displaced by newer technology and any inability or failure to adapt to technological developments, the evolving competitive landscape or industry trends could harm our business and competitiveness.\n\nAs part of our wastewater treatment portfolio, we provide the C-Tech technology package, which is a sequencing batch reactor (\"SBR\") technology, and as part of our solid waste treatment portfolio, we offer the OREX technology. While we have not experienced any technological disruption in the past with respect to the technologies we offer, there can be no assurance that technological changes in the future shall not displace our current business offerings. Third parties may succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 43, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "are more effective than those developed or marketed by us, or that would make our technology obsolete or noncompetitive. Accordingly, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond quickly to technological changes. We may not have the resources to do this. Failure to conduct research and development, innovate and focus on new technologies that provide superior alternatives to traditional / existing environmental technologies and service offerings may negatively impact our financial results. For example, as per the F\\&S Report, SBR is a key wastewater treatment technology in India, representing about $28 \\%$ to $30 \\%$ of installed capacity for municipal and industrial plants. In case the adoption of the SBR technology in the relevant market does not increase, or is replaced by alternate technologies, it will have an adverse impact of our growth prospects.\n\nOur technology systems are critical to our operations. Malfunctions of these technologies which are mechanical in nature, including disruptions due to wear and tear, natural or man-made disasters (e.g. terrorism or cyber intrusion) or equipment failure, could interrupt operations, create incremental operational and safety risks or negatively impact our service to our customers and our business reputation. System failures could also impede our ability to collect and report operational data timely or comply with regulations associated with our operations.\n\nThe identification of new and emerging technologies may be a risk and an opportunity to our business. Research and development of new technologies may require significant spending which may negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. Failure to innovate and focus on new technologies that provide superior alternatives to traditional / existing environmental technologies and service offerings may negatively impact our financial results and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\n2. We derive a significant part of our revenue from our top 10 customers and we do not have long term contracts with most of these customers. If one or more of such customers choose not to source their requirements from us or to terminate our long-term contracts, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently generate a significant portion of our revenues from our top 10 customers. The following table sets out our revenue from our top 10 customers for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and for the Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, including as a percentage of revenue from operations for the respective fiscals:\n\n| Particulars | Three months ended June 30, 2024 |  | Fiscal 2024 |  | Fiscal 2023 |  | Fiscal 2022 |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Revenue (in \u20b9 millions) | \\% of revenue from operations | Revenue (in \u20b9 millions) | \\% of revenue from operations | Revenue (in \u20b9 millions) | \\% of revenue from operations | Revenue (in \u20b9 millions) | \\% of revenue from operations |\n| Top 10 <br> customers | 591.88 | $62.91 \\%$ | 3,891.10 | $59.10 \\%$ | 3,045.14 | $58.60 \\%$ | 3,126.94 | $62.95 \\%$ |\n\nNote: The top 10 customers of our Company in the last Fiscal include Goa Waste Management Corporation, GVPR Engineers Limited, Visbsaraj Environment Private Limited, Enviro Control Private Limited, SMC Infrastructures Private Limited, HNB Engineers Private Limited, Khilari Infrastructure Private Limited, Rajkamal Builders Infrastructure Private Limited, Gharpure Engineering \\& Constructions Private Limited and R.K. Engineers Sales Limited. These customers may not be our top 10 customers in each of the abovementioned Fiscals.\n\nThe top 10 customers of our Company vary each fiscal depending upon the contracts and their realisation during each fiscal. Our top customer for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022 contributed $16.74 \\%, 10.75 \\%, 15.80 \\%$ and $17.53 \\%$ to our revenue from operations, respectively. Our customers are a mix of private and governmental enterprises. In the WWT segment, our target customers are EPC companies who bid for STP projects, serving ultimately municipalities and government agencies that award these projects, whereas in the SWT segment, we are operating two SWT projects in Goa for the Goa Waste Management Corporation, a Government of Goa undertaking. We expect that we will continue to be reliant on our major customers for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any failure to retain these customers and/or negotiate and execute contracts on terms that are commercially viable, with these select customers, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any defaults or delays in payments by a major customer or the insolvency or financial distress by a major customer may have an adverse effect on business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn our WWT segment, we usually do not enter into long-term contracts with our customers and conduct our operations by way of purchase orders or letters of intent of varying durations with customers. These purchase orders or letters of intent with customers generally can be terminated by our customers with or without notice. Accordingly, the termination could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 44, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "Cancellation by customers or delay or reduction in their orders or instances where anticipated orders fail to materialize can result in mismatch between our inventories of raw materials and of manufactured technology products, thereby increasing our costs relating to maintaining our inventory and reducing our margins, which may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity.\n\nAdditionally, any failure to meet our customers' expectations or requirements could result in the cancellation or non-renewal of contracts or purchase orders. There are also a number of factors, other than our performance that could cause the loss of a customer. Customers may demand price reductions, set-off any payment obligations, require indemnification for themselves or their affiliates, or replace their existing products with alternative products, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n# 3. Our business has grown rapidly, including our revenue from operations that has grown at a CAGR of $15.13 \\%$ from $\\mathbb{4} 4,967.34$ million in Fiscal 2022 to $\\mathbb{4} 6,583.92$ million in Fiscal 2024, and we may fail to manage our growth effectively. \n\nWe have experienced rapid growth in our business. Our revenue from operations has grown at a CAGR of $15.13 \\%$, from $\\mathbb{4} 4,967.34$ million in Fiscal 2022 to $\\mathbb{4} 6,583.92$ million in Fiscal 2024. Our revenue from operations was $\\mathbb{4} 940.91$ million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $\\mathbb{4} 705.39$ million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. This rapid growth places a significant strain on our existing financial resources. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our clients. If we do not manage our growth effectively, increases in our operating expenses and capital investments / expenditures could outpace any increases in our revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\n\nFurther, our historical growth rates may not be indicative of future growth, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our past growth rate or secure as many customers as we have in the past. The market for our technology products and services may not continue to grow at the rate we expect or at all, and our client base may decline because of increased competition in the sector. An inability to effectively manage our growth and expansion may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and future financial performance. However, there can be no assurance that our growth strategy will be successful or that we will be able to continue to expand further, or at the same rate. The success of our business will depend greatly on our ability to effectively implement our business and growth strategy, which will be subject to a range of factors, including our ability to identify market opportunities, compete with existing companies in our markets, hire and train qualified personnel, add new strategic partners, develop or acquire new technology, the continued growth in demand for environmental technology services and changes in regulatory environment. Many of these factors are beyond our control and there is no assurance that we will succeed in implementing our strategy.\n\nAdditionally, we may face increased risks when we enter new service areas or enter new markets internationally. We may find it difficult to hire, train and retain qualified employees in the new service areas / regions, and may experience high set-up costs and dedication of substantial time and efforts of our management towards such objectives, which may not necessarily translate into growth levels at par with our existing business portfolio. As part of our expansion strategy, we may look to extend our presence internationally. Expansion into new geographic regions subjects us to various challenges, including those relating to our lack of familiarity with the culture and economic conditions of these new regions, language barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing such operations, and the lack of brand recognition and reputation in such regions. The risks involved in entering new geographic markets and expanding operations, may be higher than expected, and we may face significant competition in such markets. By expanding into new geographical regions, we could be subject to additional risks associated with establishing and conducting operations, including compliance with a wide range of laws, regulations and practices, including uncertainties associated with changes in laws, regulations and practices and their interpretation; exposure to expropriation or other government actions; and political, economic and social instability.\n\nOur business growth could strain our managerial, operational and financial resources. Our ability to manage future growth will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational, financial and management systems on a timely basis and to expand, train, motivate and manage our personnel. There can be no assurance that our personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future growth. Failure to effectively manage our expansion may lead to increased costs and reduced profitability and may adversely affect our growth prospects. Our inability to manage our business and implement our growth strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 45, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# 4. We have working capital and capital expenditure / investment requirements, and may require additional financing to meet those requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \n\nWe are required to maintain a high level of working capital for our business operations, primarily for funding our purchase of raw materials. Accordingly, our Company has substantial capital expenditure and working capital requirements. The SWT industry is capital-intensive in nature. The agreements entered into with our customers in the SWT segment required an investment of up to $25 \\%$ of the project cost in the form of equity, which is being repaid over several years after commissioning. In addition, we are also required to provide performance bank guarantee amounting up to $10 \\%$ of the project cost which is released after issuance of completion certificate or other agreed milestone. The actual amount and timing of our future investments or capital expenditure or working capital requirements may differ from estimates due to, among other factors, unforeseen delays or cost overruns, unanticipated expenses, regulatory changes, economic conditions, design changes, technological changes, additional market developments and new opportunities in the industry.\n\nAs we pursue our growth plan, we expect that we will have to raise additional funds by incurring further indebtedness or issuing additional equity to meet our investment or capital expenditures or working capital needs in the future. Our sources of additional financing, in the event that we need to draw on them to meet our working capital or capital expenditure needs, may include the incurrence of debt, the issue of equity or debt securities or a combination of both. Our ability to arrange financing and the costs of capital of such financing are dependent on numerous factors, including general economic and capital market conditions, credit availability from banks, investor confidence, the continued success of our operations and other laws that are conducive to our raising capital in this manner. If we decide to raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt or issuance of debt securities or a combination of both, our interest and debt repayment obligations will increase, which could have a significant effect on our profitability and cash flows. If we do incur debt in the future, our interest and debt repayment obligations will increase, which may adversely affect our profitability and cash flows. We may also become subject to restrictive covenants in our financing agreements, which could limit our ability to access cash flows from operations and undertake certain types of transactions. Any issuance of equity to raise additional funds, on the other hand, would result in a dilution of the ownership of existing shareholders and our earnings per Equity Share.

Orders in our order book may be delayed, modified or cancelled, which may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nOur past as well as our existing order book in the waste water treatment segment and our growth rate may not be indicative of the number of orders we will receive or our growth in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we had an order book in the waste water treatment segment of $\u20b9 6,314.90$ million and comprised of 222 ongoing and upcoming projects. We prepare our order book for the WWT segment on the basis of anticipated revenue of WWT business from the unexecuted portions of existing contracts / orders as well as from the new orders. Our order book for the WWT segment was \u20b96,608.76 million as of June 30, 2024, \u20b96,564.47 million as of March 31, 2024, \u20b95,574.20 million as of March 31, 2023 and \u20b95,280.90 million as of March 31, 2022.

For further details, see \"Our Business - Competitive Strengths - High proportion of repeat business with strong order book\" on page 265. Our order book may be materially impacted if the time taken or amount payable for completion of any ongoing order of our Company changes. The growth of our order book is a cumulative indication of the revenues that we expect to recognize in future periods with respect to our existing contracts. In addition, the actual revenue from operations may vary substantially from the projected value of our order book due to modification and/or cancellation of the projects which have been awarded to us, pursuant to the contractual arrangement with our customers.\n\nFurthermore, we cannot guarantee that the income anticipated in our order book will be realized, or, if realized, will be realized on time or result in profits. Our past as well as our existing order book and our growth rate may not be indicative of the number of orders we will receive or our growth in the future. Our order book only represents business that is confirmed by way of executed letters of acceptance, agreements or purchase orders, although this is subject to, among other things, cancellation or early termination due to any breach of our contractual obligations, our inability to deliver products within the stipulated time or failure to supply products as per the specifications that have been agreed upon, failure to maintain any license or the suspension or revocation of license, non-payment by our customers, delays in the initiation of our production, unanticipated variations or adjustments in the scope and schedule of our obligations for reasons outside our and our customers' control or change in budget appropriations. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which an order forming part of our order book will be performed. In Fiscal 2022, we have experienced cancellation of a project due to abandonment of the project by a contractor, and there can be no assurance that orders will not be cancelled or terminated prematurely in the future, and we will receive any applicable termination payments in time or at all or that the amount paid will be adequate to enable us to recover its investments in respect of the prematurely cancelled order. In such events, we may have to bear the actual costs for such production incurred by us which may exceed the agreed work, as a result of which our future earnings maybe lower from the amount of the order book and if any of the forgoing risks materialize, our cash flow position, revenues and earnings may be adversely affected.\n\nFor some of the contracts in our order book, our customers are obliged to perform or take certain actions before they can install our technology at their facility. If customers do not perform these and other actions in a timely manner or at all, they could delay collection of finished products from our facilities which could result in a delay in collecting receivables by us and could materially affect our revenues. In addition, if these circumstances have not been addressed in our contracts with customers, our sales / projects could be delayed, modified or cancelled and as a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 47, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# 6. The success of our business operations is dependent on our key managerial personnel, including our senior management as well as our ability to attract, train and retain such employees. If we lose key members of our management team or are unable to attract and retain executives, key personnel and employees we need to support our operations and growth, our business and future growth prospects may be harmed. \n\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued services and contributions of our senior management and key managerial personnel, including Sandeep Sudhakar Asolkar, our Chairman and Managing Director. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key employees could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees. The inputs and experience of our key managerial personnel and senior management, in particular, and other key personnel are valuable for the development of our business and operations and the strategic directions taken by us. For further information on our key managerial personnel and Directors, see \"Our Management\" on page 301 .\n\nOur ability to sustain our growth depends upon our ability to attract and retain key personnel, developing managerial experience to address emerging business and operating challenges and ensuring a high standard of customer service. We cannot assure you that these individuals or any other member of our key managerial personnel will not leave us or join a competitor or that we will be able to retain such personnel or find adequate replacements in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, we may require a long period of time to hire and train replacement personnel when qualified personnel terminate their employment with us. We may also be required to increase our levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive in attracting employees that our business requires. The loss of the services of such persons may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As on date, our Company does not have a business succession policy in place, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively formulate or implement appropriate succession plans in the future. Any loss of members of our senior management team or key personnel could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives, affect our succession planning and could harm our business and customer relationships.\n\nWe may also face attrition of our existing workforce as a result of increased competition or other factors relating to our businesses. If we cannot hire additional qualified personnel or retain them, our ability to expand our business will be impaired and our revenue could decline. We will need to recruit new employees, who will have to be trained and integrated into our operations. We will also have to train existing employees to adhere properly to internal controls and risk management procedures. Failure to train and motivate our employees properly may result in an increase in employee attrition rates, require additional hiring, erode the quality of customer service, divert management resources and impose significant costs on us.\n\n## 7. Under-utilization of our manufacturing and installed waste treatment capacities, and an inability to effectively utilize our current capacities could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects and future financial performance.\n\nOur existing manufacturing plants in Maharashtra, India with respect to our wastewater treatment operations and our solid waste treatment plants in Goa, India are subject to operating risks, such as the breakdown or failure of equipment, power supply or processes, performance below expected levels of efficiency, obsolescence, labour disputes, natural disasters, industrial accidents and the need to comply with the regulatory requirements.\n\nWith respect to our wastewater treatment operations, we commenced our decanter manufacturing with Phase I of our Pune decanter unit situated at PAP G/8/7, Chakan Industrial Area, Phase-III, Village - Kuruli, Chakan - 410501 Maharashtra, India (Unit - I).

Underutilization of our manufacturing capacities over extended periods, or significant under-utilization in the short term could adversely impact our business, growth prospects, future financial performance and negatively impact the return on investment of the shareholders on their capital invested.\n\n# 8. Failure by third parties to supply, manufacture or deliver materials and components according to schedules, prices, quality, and volumes that are acceptable to us, or our inability to manage these materials and parts effectively may lead to delays in delivery of technology solutions to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business, sales, and our ability to retain and expand our base of customers. \n\nOur technology offerings contain materials, components and equipment purchased from a network of suppliers which exposes us to potential component shortages or delays. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, labour issues, outbreak of wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control could also affect these suppliers' ability to deliver raw materials or components to us or to remain solvent and operational. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, it may reduce our access to materials, components and equipment, and require us to search for new suppliers. We have an exclusive supply agreement with one of our suppliers pursuant to which we cannot engage or promote other suppliers providing the components supplied by our exclusive supplier, which limits our ability to source those components from other suppliers. Additionally, we have entered into strategic partnerships through distributor agreement / supply agreements / license agreements executed with certain foreign suppliers by the virtue of which our Company has the exclusive rights to procure / sell / manufacture technology components. In case these agreements were to expire, or the terms are renegotiated, we could face supply chain disruptions or price fluctuations which could adversely affect our business operations and profitability. The unavailability of any material / component / equipment or supplier could result in production delays, inability to manufacture / produce our technologies, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes, failure to supply / deliver our product offerings to our customers on time or at all. Our suppliers may not be willing or able to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, or to do so may cost us more, which may require us to replace them with other sources. While we may be able to secure additional or alternate sources for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all.\n\nIf we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of raw materials and component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement inventory management and other systems to manage our supply chain and components management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.\n9. The SWT projects we operate have been awarded primarily through competitive bidding process and our bids may not always be accepted. We may not be able to qualify for, compete and win projects, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, our ability to negotiate the standard form of contracts for our projects may be limited and certain unusual or onerous provisions may be imposed on us, which may restrict our flexibility in undertaking our business and thereby affect the efficient execution and profitability of our projects.\n\nAs a part of our business and operations, we bid for SWT projects basis our evaluation of the feasibility and commercial viability of the respective projects. We derive a portion of our revenue from contracts awarded by undertakings of the central and state governments in India. During the three months ended June 30, 2024 and in Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue generated from SWT contracts awarded by central and state government agencies represented $16.74 \\%, 6.81 \\%, 11.44 \\%$ and $17.53 \\%$ of our consolidated revenue from operations in such periods, respectively. Projects are awarded following competitive bidding processes and satisfaction of prescribed qualification criteria. Further, some of these agreements are entered into for a fixed period of time and do not provide for auto renewal post their expiration. For instance, the concession agreement with Goa Waste Management Corporation has been issued to HWTPL and VWTPL for a period of 11.5 years from the date when HWTPL and VWTPL respectively take over the project site for the completion of construction work in 1.5 years", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 51, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "and an operational period of 10 years and do not provide for renewal post its expiration. We spend considerable time and resources in the preparation and submission of bids. We cannot assure you that we would bid where we have been prequalified to submit a bid or that our bids, when submitted or if already submitted, would be accepted. If we are not able to qualify in our own right to bid for projects, we may be required to partner and collaborate with other companies in bids for such projects. If we are unable to partner with other companies or lack the credentials to be the partner-of-choice for other companies, we may lose the opportunity to bid for projects, which could affect our growth plans. In addition, the government conducted tender processes may be subject to change in qualification criteria, unexpected delays and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that the projects for which we bid will be tendered within a reasonable time, or at all.\n\nIn the event that new SWT projects which have been announced and which we plan to bid for are not put up for tender within the announced timeframe, or qualification criteria are modified such that we are unable to qualify, our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to negotiate the terms of contracts with governmental agencies, is limited and certain unusual or onerous provisions may be imposed on us. These contracts typically have certain inherent risks associated with them, including, fixed payment intervals and terms, and our inability to renegotiate financial terms or to seek extension on the expiry of the initial term. The contract would also impose certain onerous provisions on us including restrictions in relation right to terminate the contract unilaterally without assigning any reason, liability of defects arising after termination of agreements, commitment compliance with operation and maintenance requirements, right to change the scope of work and associated details unilaterally. These onerous conditions may affect the efficient execution of our projects and may have adverse effects on our profitability. Further, projects awarded to us may be subject to litigation by unsuccessful bidders. Legal proceedings may result in delay in award of the projects and/or notification of appointed dates, for the bids where we have been successful, which may result in us having to retain unallocated resources and as a result, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, we may be required to incur substantial expenditure, time and resources in defending such litigations. Any unsuccessful outcome in any such proceedings may lead to termination of a contract awarded to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and profits.\n\n# 10. We have had negative cash flows from operating activities in the past and may continue to have negative cash flows in the future. \n\nWe have experienced negative cash flows from operations in the recent past. Our consolidated cash flows for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and for the financial years 2024, 2023 and 2022 are set forth in the table below:\n\n| Particulars | Three months <br> ended June <br> 30, 2024 | Three months <br> ended June <br> 30, 2023 | Financial Year |  |  |\n| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |\n|  |  |  | 2024 | $\\mathbf{2 0 2 3}$ | $\\mathbf{2 0 2 2}$ |\n| Net cash generated / (used in) from operating activities | 598.84 | $(69.16)$ | $(43.72)$ | 321.60 | $(41.93)$ |\n| Net cash generated/ (used in) investing activities | 78.17 | $(434.96)$ | $(760.35)$ | $(130.55)$ | $(171.68)$ |\n| Net cash generated/ (used in) from financing activities | $(598.78)$ | 370.57 | 636.98 | $(228.73)$ | 191.93 |\n| Net increase / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents | 78.23 | $(133.55)$ | $(167.09)$ | $(37.69)$ | $(21.68)$ |\n\nNegative cash flows over extended periods, or significant negative cash flows in the short term, could materially impact our ability to operate our business and implement our growth plans. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Further, we cannot assure you that our net cash flow will be positive in the future. For further information, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" on page 447.\n\n## 11. We have incurred indebtedness and are required to comply with certain restrictive covenants under our financing agreements. Any non-compliance may lead to, amongst others, accelerated repayment schedule, enforcement of security and suspension of further drawdowns, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our outstanding borrowings (on a consolidated basis) aggregated to $\u20b9 1,741.23$ million. Our financing agreements include conditions and restrictive covenants, including the requirement that we obtain consent from or intimate our respective lenders prior to carrying out certain activities and entering into certain transactions including, among others, effecting any change in our Company's capital structure, amending our Company's memorandum of association or articles of association. These restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities, competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions. Further, a breach of any of the covenants, or a failure to pay interest or indebtedness when due, under this or any", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 52, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "of our other financing arrangements, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including the termination of one or more of our credit facilities, levy of penal interest, the enforcement of any security provided, acceleration of all amounts due under such facilities, any of which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur financing agreements also generally contain certain financial covenants which vary depending on the requirements of the financial institution extending the loan and the conditions negotiated under each financing document. Such covenants may restrict or delay certain actions or initiatives that we may propose to take from time to time. We cannot assure you that we will comply with the covenants with respect to our financing arrangements in the future or that we will be able to secure waivers for any such non-compliance in a timely manner or at all. Further, while we have obtained the requisite consents from our lender with respect to the Offer, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such consents for future actions. If the obligations under any of our financing agreements are accelerated, we may have to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments under such financing documents, thereby reducing the availability of cash for our working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes.\n\n# 12. We have experienced delays in payment of certain statutory dues including employee state insurance corporation contributions, provident fund contributions and income tax payments in the past. \n\nOur Company, in the regular course of its operations, is required to pay certain statutory dues including the employee state insurance contributions, employee provident fund contributions, income tax payments, tax deductions at source, professional taxes and good and services tax. In compliance with applicable laws, during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and the Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, our Company has paid an aggregate amount of $\u20b9 128.19$ million, \u20b9947.58 million, \u20b9584.82 million and \u20b9547.01 million, respectively as statutory dues to government agencies.

While we have incurred expenses towards payment of the applicable statutory dues, we have, in the past, experienced delays in payments of certain statutory dues.

Delays in receiving payment of outstanding dues from third parties may affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThe primary collection risk of our trade receivables relates to the failure by clients to pay in a timely manner and in full, for the products and services that we have provided. We cannot assure you that we will be able to collect the full principal sums from our clients. Even for those who partially pay their bills, we may not be able to collect their remaining payments in a timely manner, or at all. Set forth below are details of our Company's trade receivables and trade receivables turnover ratios (on standalone basis) for the three months period ended on June 30, 2024, June 30, 2023 and the Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n\n| Particulars | Three months <br> ended June <br> 30, 2024 | Three months <br> ended June 30, <br> 2023 | Fiscal |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  |  | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |\n| Trade receivables (in \u20b9 million) | 1,653.10 | 1,071.01 | 2,812.78 | 1,777.18 | 1,116.07 |\n| Trade receivables turnover ratio (days) ${ }^{*}$ | 297 | 222 | 197 | 158 | 105 |\n\n*Trade receivables days is derived as trade receivables at the period end multiplied by 365 divided by revenue from operations. Days for three month period is calculated as 365/4.\n\nWhile we undertake periodic review of the outstanding amounts, regular follow-ups with parties for recovery of payments and strengthening collection processes and emphasise on taking letters of credit, there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so. While there have not been any instances of delays in receiving payment of significant outstanding dues in the three preceding Fiscals, any significant delays in receiving payment of significant outstanding dues from third parties may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n14. Our SWT business largely depends on governmental agencies and the loss of such business or a termination / non-renewal of contracts by such government agencies will have a significantly adverse impact on our business. The discontinuation or loss of business with respect to, or changes in government priorities, budget constraints, or changes in policy, for which we are engaged on contractual basis could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nOur SWT business and revenues are substantially dependent on projects or contracts awarded by government establishments, including central, state and local authorities and agencies and public sector undertakings. Any", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 54, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "adverse changes in government policies and budgetary allocation resulting from a change in government policies or priorities, could materially and adversely affect our financing, capital expenditure, revenues, or operations relating to our existing and proposed SWT projects as well as our ability to participate in competitive bidding or negotiations for our future SWT projects.\n\nWe derived over 5\\% of our consolidated revenue during the last three fiscals from Goa Waste Management Corporation, a government enterprise. Governmental agencies contributing significantly to our revenue may not renew their arrangements or may not continue to award contracts to us on a nomination basis, due to changes in government policy or budgetary allocation. While we continue to source other customers and enter into other contracts, there can be no assurance that we will be able to entirely substitute the revenue generated from existing customers in the event they do not renew their arrangements with us. A change in government policy or budgetary allocation may also affect the ability of these customers to perform their obligations under the contracts entered into with us. These and any other events that have an adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of these key customers would have a direct impact on our revenues and results of operation.\n\nGiven that we derive a significant portion of our SWT revenue from governmental agencies, we are exposed to various additional risks inherent in doing business with them, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. These risks include:\n\n- participation in contracts with government entities could subject us to stricter regulatory and testing requirements which may increase our compliance costs;\n- execution of the detailed definitive documentation and agreements with the governmental agencies may take a significant amount of time and cause delays;\n- delays in project implementation and key initiatives where we have invested significant cost;\n- delays in payment due to the time taken to complete internal processes of such entities and agencies;\n- levy of liquidated damages due to our execution delays, which may adversely affect our profit margins;\n- contracts with government agencies are awarded to the lowest bidder that meets the technical conditions of the tender, which makes winning such tenders difficult. In addition, if we have to lower our pricing in order to win tenders, it would exert pressure on our margins;\n- the tender process is long and may be subject to significant delays and/or renegotiation of the terms of the bid or lowering the price for products and services included in the tender;\n- political and economic factors such as pending elections, changes in leadership among key governmental decision makers, changes or delays in the implementation of government policies, revisions to tax policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed; and\n- any disinvestment by the Gol of its shareholding in such entities could result in a change in business operations of such entities, which may impact existing or future business arrangements between our Company and such entities.\n\n15. The objects of the Fresh Issue include funding working capital requirements, which is based on certain assumptions and estimates. Any failure in arranging adequate working capital for our operations may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial conditions.\n\nThe proposed deployment of Net Proceeds includes funding working capital requirements, which is based on management estimates and certain assumptions. For details, see \"Objects of the Offer\" on page 141. Our business requires working capital, and the actual amount of our future working capital requirements may differ from estimates as a result of, among other factors, unanticipated expenses, fluctuations in price of raw materials / components, economic conditions, growth in revenue, changes in the terms of our financing arrangements, additional market developments and new opportunities in the sector. Any delay in the Offer may impact the funding of our working capital requirements, and adversely affect our business, operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n16. Any failure to comply with trade restrictions such as economic sanctions and export controls or with antibribery and anti-corruption frameworks instituted by government authorities or international organizations, such as multilateral development banks, could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations.\n\nWe may be subject to trade restrictions, including economic sanctions and export controls, imposed by government(s) around the world or international organisations with jurisdiction over our operations, which prohibit or restrict transactions involving certain designated persons and certain designated countries or territories. Our failure to successfully comply with these laws and regulations may expose us to reputational harm as well as", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 55, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "significant sanctions, including criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts, and other remedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be expensive and disruptive. Additionally, our operations are also subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption frameworks instituted by governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the projects we participate in, as well as by international organisations, such as multilateral development banks, that finance such projects. Any failure to comply with such frameworks could lead to us becoming ineligible for participation in ongoing or future projects, consequent commercial and reputational damage, and also require significant management attention towards remedying such non-compliances and strengthening internal controls. For instance, one of our Subsidiaries, SFC Umwelttechnik GmbH, a company registered in Austria, was included in the World Bank List of Debarred Firms from November 21, 2016 to February 20, 2018, following the identification of fraudulent practices under two World Bank-financed projects in Vietnam. As a consequence of such debarment, SFC Umwelttechnik GmbH was also debarred by the Asian Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank with effect from December 22, 2016 and January 3, 2017 respectively, in each case up to February 20, 2018. The Subsidiary was not eligible to participate in any contracts for projects funded by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank or the Inter-American Development Bank during the respective periods of debarment. While the Subsidiary no longer appears in such watchlists, there can be no assurance that we or any of our Subsidiaries will not appear in any such watchlists in the future, including due to failure to adhere to the relevant governance norms instituted by such multilateral development banks.\n\nIn addition, any perceived or actual breach of compliance by us with respect to applicable laws, rules, and regulations could have a significant impact on our reputation and could cause us to lose existing customers, prevent us from obtaining new customers, negatively impact investor sentiment about our Company, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by violations and to avert further violations, and expose us to legal risk and potential liability, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n# 17. Our Company requires significant amounts of working capital for continued growth. Our inability to meet our working capital requirements, on commercially acceptable terms, may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe propose to utilise \u20b9 906.88 million from the Net Proceeds to fund the working capital for meeting business requirements of our Company in Fiscals 2026 and 2027. Our business requires a substantial amount of working capital on account of multiple factors such as trade receivables from our customers, which represent payments expected for goods and services rendered, inventories on account of business operations requirements, and fixed deposits in lien for various credit facilities. We fund our working capital requirements primarily through our internal accruals and borrowings from banks. Our Company's outstanding working capital facilities (including fund based and non-fund based) as of September 30, 2024 amounted to $\u20b9 878.26$ million. We also intend to use \u20b9 906.88 million from the Net Proceeds towards funding our working capital requirements. The estimates have not been appraised by any bank or financial institution or other independent agency and no appraising entity has been appointed for the Offer. The proposed fund deployment is based on internal management estimates basis the current circumstances of our business, and we may have to revise our estimates from time to time on account of various factors, such as financial and market conditions, competition, interest rate fluctuations and other external factors, which may not be within the control of our management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure adequate financing in the future on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, including in the event our lenders call in loans repayable on demand or if there is a change in applicable regulations. Our inability to obtain or maintain sufficient cash flow, credit facilities and other sources of funding, in a timely manner, or at all, to meet our working capital requirements or to pay our debts, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For details on our working capital facilities, see \"Financial Indebtedness\" on page 476.\n\nAt this stage, we cannot determine with any certainty if we would require the Net Proceeds to meet any other expenditure or fund any exigencies arising out of competitive environment, business conditions, economic conditions or other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to deploy the Net Proceeds in a timely or efficient manner, our business and results of operations may be affected. We operate in a competitive and dynamic industry and may need to revise our estimates from time to time based on changes in a number of factors, including timely completion of the Offer, general economic and business conditions, increasing regulations or changes in government policies, competitive landscape, as well as general factors affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition and access to capital such as credit availability and interest rate levels, which are beyond our control. In accordance with Section 27 of the Companies Act, 2013, we cannot undertake any variation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds without obtaining the Shareholders' approval through a special resolution. In the event of any such circumstances that require us to undertake variation in the disclosed utilization of the Net Proceeds, we may not be able to obtain the Shareholders' approval in a timely manner, or at all. Any delay or", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 56, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "inability in obtaining such Shareholders' approval may adversely affect our business or operations.

An adverse outcome in any of these proceedings may affect our reputation, standing and future business, and could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n19. We depend on a few suppliers for the supply of majority of our raw materials and we do not have continuing and exclusive supply agreements with them. Any interruptions in the supply of raw materials, fluctuations in raw material prices or any failure by our suppliers to make timely delivery of raw materials could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\n\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for supply of raw materials and components required for our operations, which subjects us to concentration risk. Some of our primary raw materials and components for manufacturing include decanters, diffusers, spares and PVC pipes. We procure these materials typically through purchase orders which set out the terms and conditions in relation to quantity, pricing and delivery details and do not enter into any continuing and exclusive supply agreements with our suppliers, making our business vulnerable to fluctuations in prices of materials. If our suppliers do not perform their obligations in a timely manner or cease operations or decide to discontinue our supply relationships, or at all, we would need to find alternative suppliers, within a requisite span of time and our ability to manufacture our products may be adversely affected and we may breach our contractual obligations to our customers. While we have not experienced any instance where any of our suppliers did not fulfil their obligations in a timely manner in the last three Fiscals and three months ended June 30, 2024 that resulted in a material adverse impact on our operations, we cannot assure that such instances will not arise in the future. Given the sensitivity of our operations to material costs, effective management of our supply chain and strategic sourcing remains crucial to mitigating these risks. See also, \"Our Business Procurement\" on page 276.\n\nThe table below sets forth the cost of raw materials which we have obtained from our top 10 suppliers for the years indicated:\n\n| Particulars | Three months ended <br> June 30, 2024 | For the Financial Year |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |\n| Cost of raw materials and traded goods supplied by top 10 suppliers (in \\$ million) | 246.67 | $2,189.94$ | $2,019.00$ | $1,480.00$ |\n| Cost of raw materials and traded goods supplied by top 10 suppliers, as a percentage of cost of raw materials consumed (\\%) | $52.95 \\%$ | $63.59 \\%$ | $61.60 \\%$ | $47.42 \\%$ |\n\nNote: The top 10 suppliers of our Company in the last Fiscal include TurboMax Company Limited, Yucheon International Co. Ltd., Environmental Dynamics International INC and CEE Square Engineers. These suppliers may not be our top 10 suppliers in each of the abovementioned Fiscals and the disclosure of names has only been made for such suppliers who have consented to being named. The remainder of our top 10 suppliers have not been named in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus due to nonreceipt of consents from such suppliers and potential confidentiality restrictions.\n\nIf one or more of our suppliers ceases supply to our Company for reasons including due to commercial disagreements, insolvency of the supplier or supply chain issues, we may be unable to source our raw materials from alternative suppliers on similar commercial terms or within a reasonable timeframe. This may adversely impact our production and eventually our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. In such a scenario, we may also breach contractual terms of delivery and installation which we have entered into with our customers, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\n20. Our failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies in the future could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations or cause us to curtail or cease our operations.\n\nAs we pursue our growth plan, our Company will have additional capital expenditures / investments and working capital requirements. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditure or working capital requirements may differ from estimates due to, among other factors, unforeseen delays or cost overruns, unanticipated expenses, regulatory changes, economic conditions, design changes, technological changes, additional market developments and new opportunities in the industry. As per our estimates, our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations but our expenses may be greater than forecasted and we may need to raise additional funds to continue our operations in the future. We nevertheless may be required to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund our business operations. There can be no assurance that", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 58, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. We may be required to pursue sources of additional capital through various means, including debt or equity financings. If we are able to raise additional equity financing, our Shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the value of our securities could decline. If we were to engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. In addition, the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control. Our ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets and our financial history, which could impact the availability or cost of future financings. In light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable terms or at all to fund investments, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, debt refinancing or other corporate needs, or that our counterparties in any such financings would honour their contractual commitments. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to execute on our growth strategy, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our business or we may have to curtail or cease our operations.\n\nIf we decide to raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt or issuance of debt securities or a combination of both, our interest and debt repayment obligations will increase, which could have a significant effect on our profitability and cash flows. We may also become subject to restrictive covenants in our financing agreements, which could limit our ability to access cash flows from operations and undertake certain types of transactions. Any issuance of equity to raise additional funds, on the other hand, would result in a dilution of the ownership of existing shareholders and our earnings per Equity Share.\n\nOur working capital requirements may increase if the payment terms in our agreements with our clients include reduced advance payments or longer payment schedules. For further details, see \"Objects of the Offer\" on page 141. These factors may result in increases in the amount of our receivables and short-term borrowings. Continued increases in our working capital requirements or our inability to obtain financing at favourable terms, or at all may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n# 21. Certain of our immovable properties, where some of our manufacturing units are located, are leased. If we are unable to renew existing leases or relocate our operations on commercially reasonable terms, there may be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations. \n\nSome of our business operations are being conducted on premises leased from third parties. To set up our upcoming office space, we have taken on lease Units 2201 and 2202, $22^{\\text {nd }}$ Floor, Rupa Renaissance, D-33, D207, Juinagar, MIDC Road, TTC Industrial Area, Navi Mumbai - 400705, Maharashtra, India for a term of 108 months ending May 14, 2033. Further, some of our manufacturing facilities are situated on leased properties. Phase I of our Pune decanter unit is situated on a leased premises at PAP G/8/7, Chakan Industrial Area, Phase-III, Village - Kuruli, Chakan - 410501 Maharashtra, India, and phase II of our Pune decanter unit is situated on a leased premises at PAP-S-79, Chakan Industrial Area Phase-II, Air Liquide Chowk, Village: Savardari, Chakan - 410501 Maharashtra, India. The blowers manufacturing unit operated by our Associate, Turbomax India Private Limited is situated on a leased premises at D-32, MIDC Phase III, Sagaon, Dombivli East, Dombivli - 421204 Maharashtra, India. Further, our Subsidiary, SFC Ekotechnika, s.r.o, manufactures C-MEM Hollow Fibre at its manufacturing unit on a leased premised situated at Krizikova 210725601 Benesov, Czech Republic. The tenure of the leases is generally agreed in the relevant lease agreements. While there are currently no instances of noncompliance of the terms of our lease agreements, there can be no assurance that there will be no such noncompliance leading to termination of such leases in the future. Any change in the terms and conditions of the lease agreements and any premature termination of such lease agreements may have an adverse impact on our operations.\n\nAny adverse impact on the title, ownership rights, development rights of the owners from whose premises we operate, breach of the contractual terms of any lease, leave and license agreements, or any inability to renew such agreements on acceptable terms may also affect our operations. In addition, the terms of certain of our leases require us to obtain the lessor's prior consent for certain actions, including making structural alterations to the leased premises, which may be required if we were to undertake an expansion in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these leasing arrangements at commercially favourable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew all or any of our leasing arrangements, it may cause disruptions in our business and we may incur substantial costs associated with shifting to new premises, all of which may adversely affect our business operations.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 59, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# 22. Our actual cost in executing an SWT contract may vary substantially from the assumptions underlying our bid. We may be unable to recover all or some of the additional expenses, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. \n\nOur cost estimates depend on a number of factors including costs of materials, provisions for cost escalation due to increase or decrease in rates and price of labour, equipment, fleet of vehicles and other material inputs. Currently we submit monthly invoices for the valuation of materials used on our SWT business operations. We may, in the future, enter into contracts which may not contain price escalation clauses covering increase in the cost of fuel, labour and other inputs. Accordingly, our actual expense in executing the contract may vary substantially from the assumptions underlying our bid for several reasons, including, but not limited to unanticipated increases in the cost of fuel, material labour or other inputs, unforeseen construction conditions, delay in transfer of land by the government or obtaining rights of way, our inability to obtain requisite environmental and other approvals, permits and clearances resulting in delays and increased costs, delays caused by local weather conditions.\n\nUnanticipated increases in the price of materials, fuel costs, labour or other inputs not taken into account in our bid may also have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract. Our ability to pass on increases in the cost of fuel, equipment, labour and other inputs may be limited in the case of contracts with limited or no price escalation provisions and we cannot assure you that these variations in cost will not lead to financial losses to our Company.\n\n## 23. We employ a significant number of personnel in our business operations which are a substantial part of our total expenses and are susceptible to risks relating to compliance with labour laws and our operations could be adversely affected by labour shortages, strikes, work stoppages or increased wage demands by our employees or any other kind of disputes with our employees.\n\nWe are subject to various labour laws in India including the Factories Act, 1948 and the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, and we may be held responsible in the event of any default by us or the independent contractor engaged by us who contracts with the contracted workers as well as in making payment of wages or providing benefits such as payment of, or contribution to, provident fund. Changes in labour laws, such as minimum wage laws, may also require us to incur additional costs, such as raising salaries or increasing our contributions to the EPF. For example, in order to rationalize and reform labour laws in India, the Government of India has notified four labour codes which are yet to completely come into force as on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, namely, (i) the Code on Wages, 2019, (iii) the Code on Social Security, 2020; and (iv) the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020. Such codes will replace the existing legal framework governing rights of workers and labour relations. Once these codes are in full force, we may be required to incur additional expenditure to ensure compliance with them. The implementation of laws enhancing employee benefits may increase our employee and labour costs, thereby adversely impacting our results of operations, cash flows, business and financial performance.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our Company had an aggregate of 178 employees. Further, our skilled workforce included 97 engineers as on September 30, 2024. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, and for the Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, our consolidated employee benefits expense was $\u20b9 182.46$ million, $\u20b9 125.97$ million, $\u20b9 600.00$ million, $\u20b9 494.73$ million and $\u20b9 437.71$ million, respectively, constituting $19.83 \\%$, $18.05 \\%, 12.33 \\%, 12.21 \\%$, and $10.95 \\%$ respectively, of our consolidated total expense for such periods. While we have not experienced any material incidents in the past, our operations could be adversely affected by labour shortages, strikes, increased labour costs or work stoppages or failure of our personnel to adequately perform their duties including rendering deficient services, shortage in shift, absenteeism or unpunctuality, any misuse or contravention of laws or policies or breach of confidentiality by existing or former employee and criminal acts, torts or other negligent acts by our employees and contractual employees, and could result in significant disruptions or delays in our ability to provide services. These claims may give rise to litigation and claims for damages, which could be time-consuming. In three months ended June 30, 2024 and Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, we did not face any material instances of employee disruptions, or claims against us by our employees. In the event of labour shortages, we may have difficulties recruiting or retaining employees or it may cause us to incur additional costs and result in delays or disruption to our operations.\n\n## 24. Failure to effectively treat emerging contaminants or failure of our treatment systems or spills causing discharge of untreated or partially treated wastes can lead to various damages including environmental damage and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\n\nA number of emerging contaminants might be found in water and solid wastes that we treat in addition to other pathogens and hazardous substances that have the potential to cause any number of illnesses and infections.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 60, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "Workers may be exposed to these contaminants / pathogens before the wastes are treated. In case any of our SWT facilities are not operated properly, or in case of a malfunction of our technology resulting in the waste not getting fully treated, we run the risk of third-party exposure to contaminants that are generated as by-products. The potential impact of a failure to treat is difficult to predict and could lead to an increased risk of exposure to property damage, natural resource damage, personal injury or even product liability claims, increased scrutiny by governmental regulatory agencies and negative publicity. Further, an outbreak of disease in any of the localities we serve could result in a widespread loss of customers across other such markets.\n\n# 25. We are exposed to significant cost variations on fixed-rate contracts. \n\nUnder the terms and conditions of our contracts, we generally agree to a fixed rate for providing waste collection, cleaning, sweeping, disposal waste aggregation and waste processing services. We are provided with limited escalation in price after a specified period. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition due to such variations in fixed-rate contracts. However, we cannot assure you that such variations will not occur in the future or result in a material adverse effect. The actual expenses incurred by us while executing a fixed-price contract may vary substantially from our bid for various reasons, including but not limited to:\n\n- unanticipated increases in the cost of equipment, materials or manpower;\n- changes in taxes and duties;\n- delays due to non-receipt of client approvals or payments at specific project milestones;\n- delays associated with the delivery of equipment and materials to the project site;\n- delays caused by local weather conditions;\n- disputes arising out of the contract; and\n- suppliers or sub-contractors' failure to perform.\n\nUnanticipated costs or delays in performing a part of the contract can also have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract. In addition, we may be required to pay liquidated damages to the client for any delay. These variations and the risks are generally inherent to the businesses in which we operate and may result in our revenues or profits being different from those originally estimated resulting in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n## 26. We are dependent on R\\&D for our future success. While we do not have any formal R\\&D programme in place currently, if we do not successfully develop new products or continue our product portfolio expansion in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to stay abreast of the constantly evolving industry trends and to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our business offerings. In order to attract and retain customers and compete against our competitors, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development to enhance our technology. The waste treatment industry is characterized by technological evolution, introduction of new technologies, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices, any of which could render our existing technologies and systems obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to identify, develop, acquire or license leading technologies useful in our business, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely way. There can be no assurance that we will be able to use new technologies effectively or adapt our existing technologies to meet customer requirements or emerging industry standards. If we are unable to adapt in a cost-effective and timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer preferences, whether for technical, legal, financial or other reasons, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe have a track record of successfully expanding into new product / service categories. Developing and launching enhancements to our technologies / offerings may also involve significant technical risks and upfront capital investments that may not generate return on investment. We may use new technologies ineffectively, or we may fail to adapt to emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced technologies or if our recently introduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our expectations, our customers may forego the use of our technologies in favour of those of our competitors.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 61, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# 27.

The products we manufacture and procure are required to meet precise and specific requirements including in terms of quality, measurements and efficiency. While no penalty amounts have been levied on us for failing to deliver services as stipulated in the terms of the respective contracts with our customers during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and the Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, failure by us to achieve or maintain compliance with these requirements or quality standards may disrupt our ability to supply products sufficient to meet our customers' demands, which may lead to us incurring costs for repairing or replacing defective products as well as conducting product recalls and paying warranty and liability claims or the customer offsetting any such amounts from payments due to us from such customer and/or cancellation of existing and future orders, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nOur agreements also impose confidentiality restrictions from disclosing certain information to any third-parties, and have standard liability clauses in relation to quality and delivery of our products, which ordinarily do not have any limits.

We may be liable for the non-performance of our consortium or joint venture partners. \n\nWe selectively enter into consortium arrangements and joint ventures towards development of waste treatment projects. In order to establish or preserve relationships with such partners, we may agree to assume risks and contribute resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we expect to receive in the related joint venture. Such agreements may reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we would have received if our assumed risks and contributed resources were proportionate to our returns.\n\nIn the event there are differences with our partners and/or if we do not have adequate experience in such sector, we may not be able to recover the capital that we have invested, in addition to the relevant project being adversely affected, as a consequence of which, we may be impacted by such contractual liability arising pursuant to project not being completed on time. We may, in certain instances, fail to reach agreement on significant decisions on a timely basis.\n\nA breach or inability of our partners to continue with a project, due to financial, legal or other difficulties, could result in us being required to bear increased and, at times, sole responsibility for the completion of the project and a greater share of the financial risk of the project. While no such liability has arisen on us in the past, in the event that a claim, arbitration award or judgment is awarded against the joint venture or the consortium, we may be responsible to the client for the entire claim, irrespective of whether or not we are indemnified by our consortium partner. The occurrence of any or all of the above events may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## 30. Information relating to capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and operational plants included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus are based on various assumptions and estimates. Underutilization of our capacities and an inability to effectively utilize such capacities may have an adverse effect on our business and future financial performance.\n\nInformation relating to our capacity, actual production and capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and operational plants included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus is based on various assumptions and estimates of our management and independent chartered engineer, namely, AN Somase and Associates, including proposed operations, assumptions relating to availability and quality of raw materials, range of product mix, potential utilization levels and operational efficiencies. For further information regarding our manufacturing facilities and estimated capacity utilization, see \"Our Business - Our Manufacturing Capacity\" on page 269. Actual and future manufacturing volumes and capacity utilization rates may differ significantly from the estimated production capacities of our manufacturing facilities. Undue reliance should therefore not be placed on the information relating to our installed capacities of our manufacturing facilities included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. Further, there is no guarantee that our future production or capacity utilization levels will match or exceed our historical levels. Under-utilization of our manufacturing capacities over extended periods, or significant underutilization in the short term could increase our cost of production and our operating costs and adversely impact our business, growth prospects and future financial performance. Our expected return on capital invested is subject to, among other factors, the ability to ensure satisfactory performance of personnel to further grow our business, our ability to absorb additional infrastructure costs and utilize the expanded capacities as anticipated.\n\n## 31. Our WWT operations in India experience seasonality, and any disruptions or underperformance during seasonal periods could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur Indian WWT business segment is subject to seasonal trends and a significant portion of our revenue from WWT business operations is made in the second half of the financial year. To that extent, our Company's", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 63, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "standalone India wastewater business is subject to seasonality of revenue.

If we fail to achieve expected sales or face unexpected disruptions in the second half of the financial year, our overall financial performance and cash flow for the Fiscal in question could be adversely impacted. Any slowdown in demand for environmental technology services or any failure by us to accurately anticipate and prepare for such seasonal fluctuations in revenue or any inefficiencies or disruptions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n# 32. Our growth may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic factors. \n\nDemand for our technology products and services that we offer is significantly affected by the general level of commercial activity and economic conditions in the regions in which we operate. Our results of operations are affected by the level of urban / industrial activity, which in turn is affected by the macroeconomic conditions in the economy and the industry in which we operate. Any slowdown in the global economy or India's economic growth, or the waste treatment industry in India, could affect the overall business environment and specifically demand for waste treatment technology leading to a decrease in demand for our technologies for prolonged periods. For details of fluctuations in demand in the wastewater treatment and solid waste treatment industry in India in recent years, see \"Industry Overview\" on page 181.\n\nSuch macroeconomic events could lead to a reduction in the demand for our technologies. We may also experience more competitive pricing pressure during periods of economic downturn. We cannot assure you that such macroeconomic and other factors, which are beyond our control would not significantly affect demand for our technological solutions. Consequently, the occurrence of such events could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## 33. The assets we operate, and the handling and treatment of waste expose us to safety, operational and other risks, including the risk of personal injury to our employees or third parties. Failure to limit our exposure to such risks may subject us to significant disruptions in our business, legal and regulatory actions, costs, and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\nOur business requires our team members to handle the wastes which may be infectious or hazardous to life and property. Our operations include activities that could be hazardous to the health of our employees which include risks such as infections, exposition to harmful waste materials, equipment malfunctions, work accidents, fire or explosion, including hazards that may cause injury and loss of life, environmental damage. The provision of environmental technology and services, including the operation of our facilities and other waste-related assets, involves risks. While we try to handle such materials with care and in accordance with accepted and safe methods, the possibility of accidents, leaks, and spills (including those caused by natural disasters) always exists. These risks may present possible exposure to contaminated or infectious waste or other hazardous materials include, among others, the risk of equipment defects, damaged or leaking containers, improper storage of waste, placement of prohibited materials into the waste stream, malfunctions and failures, improper use of dangerous equipment, the release of hazardous substances, fire and explosion, any of which could result in environmental liability, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption or property damage or destruction. While we seek to minimize our exposure to these risks through maintenance, training and compliance programs, any substantial losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, while we carry liability insurance intended to cover these contingencies, instances may occur that are not insured against or that are inadequately insured against. An uninsured or underinsured loss could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 64, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "While we provide a safe and healthy working environment which is compliant with applicable occupational health and safety norms, we may encounter accidents at our facilities. Any such accident may result in personal injury to our employees, or the labour deployed at our facilities, destruction of property or equipment, manufacturing or delivery delays, environmental damage, or may lead to suspension of our operations and/or imposition of liabilities. Additionally, the occurrence of any of these risks may also adversely affect public perception about our operations, the perception of our suppliers and clients and the morale and attrition rate of our employees. These liabilities and costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have encountered incidents in the past where labourers have met with accidents, and there can be no assurance that such incidents may not occur in the future. However, any such future accident may result in litigation, the outcome of which is difficult to assess or quantify, the cost to defend such litigation can be significant and our insurance may not be sufficient to provide complete coverage. As a result, the costs to defend any action or the potential liability resulting from any such accident or death or arising out of any other litigation, and any negative publicity associated therewith, may have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and future prospects. We may be unable to mitigate these risks through contractual limitations of liability, indemnities and insurance. Losses may arise from risks not addressed in our agreements or insurance policies, or we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance against some risks on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nThe occurrence of any hazards could result in a suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal liabilities.

To foster our growth, our Company may also consider entering into different jurisdictions wherein we may be required to fulfil the state-wise respective compliances, laws and regulatory norms which differ from state to state. While we have obtained a number of approvals required for our operations, we have filed an application dated August 22, 2024 for issuance of factory license under the provisions of the Factories Act, 1948 for our Pune Facility - II, and such license and certificate are currently awaited.

We operate in a competitive business environment. Competition from existing players and new entrants and consequent pricing pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business growth and prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if our competitors are able to improve the efficiency of their manufacturing processes and thereby offer their products at lower prices, our revenues and profitability may decline.\n\nWe are required to compete both in the domestic and international markets. We may be unable to compete with the prices and products offered by our competitors (local as well as international). We may have to compete with new players in India and abroad who enter the market and are able to offer competing products. Our competitors may have access to greater financial, manufacturing, research and development, marketing, distribution and other resources and more experience in obtaining the relevant regulatory approvals. Increasing competition may result in pricing pressures and decreasing profit margins or loss of market share or failure to improve our market position, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations.

Our failure to keep our technical knowledge confidential could erode our competitive advantage. \n\nWe possess extensive technical knowledge about our technologies. Such technical knowledge has been built up through our own experiences and through our research and development. Our technical knowledge is a significant independent asset, which may not be adequately protected by intellectual property rights. Some of our technical knowledge is protected only by secrecy. As a result, we cannot be certain that our technical knowledge will remain confidential in the long run.\n\nCertain proprietary knowledge may get leaked, either inadvertently or wilfully, at various stages of the production process. A significant number of our employees have access to confidential design and product information and there can be no assurance that this information will remain confidential. Moreover, certain of our employees may leave us and join our various competitors. Although we may seek to enforce non-disclosure agreements in respect of research and development with our key employees, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully enforce such agreements. In the event that the confidential technical information in respect of our processes and products or business becomes available to third parties or to the general public, any competitive advantage we may have over our peers could be harmed. If a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalise on our technology, it may be difficult, expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection. Consequently, any leakage of confidential technical information could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\n\nFurther, if our customers' confidential information is misappropriated by us or our employees, our customers may consider us liable for that act and seek damages and compensation from us, in addition, to seeking termination of our engagements with our customers. Assertions of misappropriation of confidential information or the intellectual property of our customers against us, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if such assertions against us are unsuccessful, they may cause us to incur reputational harm and substantial cost.\n\n## 44. We conduct transactions in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nAlthough our Company's reporting currency is in Indian Rupees, we transact a significant portion of our business in several other currencies. Our global footprint exposes us to certain currency exchange risks, arising primarily from our import of goods for our operations, and foreign currency receivables.

There can be no guarantee that such fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations as we continue to expand our sales globally. The realisation of any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n# 45. Our inability to protect or use our intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business. We may also unintentionally infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, any misappropriation of which could harm our competitive position. \n\nAs of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, our Company has registered three trademarks in India and has additionally applied for the registration of two trademarks in India. Further, we have registered one trademark each in Austria and Vietnam. Further, our Subsidiary, SFC Umwelttechnik GmbH has made applications for two patent registration in Europe. For details, see \"Government and Other Approvals\" and \"Our Business - Intellectual Property\" on pages 483 and 277, respectively. Several of our trademarks have significant brand value and recognition in their respective areas, therefore, our trademarks are significant to our business and operations. There can be no assurance that our brand name or trademarks will not be adversely affected in the future by actions that are beyond our control including client complaints in relation to intellectual property rights infringement, intellectual property infringements or adverse publicity from any other source in India and abroad. Any damage to our brand name, if not immediately and sufficiently remedied, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, competitive position in India and abroad, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWhile we take care to ensure that we comply with the intellectual property rights of others, we cannot determine with certainty whether we are infringing any existing third-party intellectual property rights which may force us to alter our offerings. We may also be susceptible to objections and claims from third parties asserting infringement and other related claims. Any such claims raised in the future could result in costly litigation, divert management's attention and resources, subject us to significant liabilities and require us to enter into potentially expensive royalty or licensing agreements or to cease certain offerings. Further, necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. If claims or actions are adjudicated against us from third parties asserting infringement and other related claims in India and abroad, we may be required to obtain a license, modify our existing technology or cease the use of such technology and design, or use a new non-infringing technology. Such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly. Further, necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.

We may also be liable for any past infringement. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nFailure to register or renew the registration of any of our registered intellectual properties may affect our right to use such intellectual properties in future or allow others to use our solutions and designs as available in the public domain, without our consent. Further, if we are unable to register our intellectual properties for any reason, including our inability to remove objections to any trademark application, or if any of our unregistered trademarks are registered in favour of or used by a third party in India or abroad, we may not be able to claim registered ownership of such trademark, and as a result, we may not be able to seek remedies for infringement of those trademarks by third parties, which would cause damage to our business prospects, reputation and goodwill. For more information, see \"Government and Other Approvals - Intellectual Property\" on page 487.\n46. Our ability to access capital at attractive costs depends on our credit ratings. Non-availability of credit ratings or a downgrade of our rating may restrict our access to capital and thereby adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nAs of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we have received the following credit ratings on our debt and credit facilities.\n\n| Financial Year | Agency | Date of credit <br> rating | Credit Rating - <br> Long Term Bank <br> Facilities | Credit Rating - <br> Short Term Bank <br> Facilities |\n| :-- | :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Fiscal 2025 | CARE Ratings Ltd. | April 02, 2024 | CARE A | CARE A 1 + |\n| Fiscal 2024 | CARE Ratings Ltd. | April 27, 2023 | CARE A - | CARE A 1 |\n| Fiscal 2023 | CARE Ratings Ltd. | April 6, 2022 | CARE A - | CARE A 1 |\n| Fiscal 2022 | CARE Ratings Ltd. | April 7, 2021 | CARE A - | CARE A 1 |\n\nCredit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the financial strength, as well as factors that may not be within our control, such as macroeconomic conditions and the rating agencies' perception of the industries in which we operate and the services we offer. Our credit rating reflects, amongst other things, the rating agency's opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Our inability to obtain such credit rating in a timely manner or any non-availability of credit ratings, or poor ratings, or any downgrade in our ratings may increase borrowing costs and constrain our access to capital and lending markets and, as a result, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, any downgrade in our credit ratings may also trigger an event of default or acceleration of repayment of certain of our borrowings and non-availability of credit ratings could increase the possibility of additional terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements. If any of these risks materialise, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n47. We rely on contract labour for carrying out certain of our operations and we may be held responsible for paying the wages of such workers, if the independent contractors through whom such workers are hired default on their obligations, and such obligations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nIn order to retain flexibility and control costs, we engage contract labour and also appoint independent contractors who in turn engage on-site contract labour for performance of certain of our operations. The cost of total labour charges for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, and for the Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\u20b9 1.77$ million, $\u20b9 3.88$ million, $\u20b9 17.62$ million, $\u20b9 7.86$ million and $\u20b9 4.45$ million, respectively. Further, our Company appoints independent contractors who in turn engage a significant number of on-site contract labourers for performance of our business operations. Even for the contract labour engaged by independent contractor, we may be held responsible for any wage payments to be made to such labourers in the event of default by such independent contractor(s). Any requirement to fund their wage requirements may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the Contract Labor (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, we may be required to absorb a number of such contract labourers as permanent employees. Thus, any such order from a regulatory body or court may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In the long term, increases in labour costs in India may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase our efficiency and productivity proportionately and we can pass on such costs in the prices that we charge our customers. Any significant increase in our labour costs may have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 72, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# 48.

In addition, such Non-GAAP Measures and industry measures are not standardized terms, and may vary from any standard methodology that is applicable across the Indian financial services industry, and therefore may not be comparable with financial or industry related statistical information of similar nomenclature computed and presented by other companies, and hence a direct comparison of these NonGAAP Measures and industry measures between companies may not be possible. Other companies may calculate these Non-GAAP Measures and industry measures differently from us, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Although such Non-GAAP Measures and industry measures are not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards, our Company's management believes that they are useful to an investor in evaluating us as they are widely used measures to evaluate a company's operating performance. These Non-GAAP Measures and other statistical and other information relating to our operations and financial performance may not be computed on the basis of any standard methodology that is applicable across the industry and therefore may not be comparable to financial measures and statistical information of similar nomenclature that may be computed and presented by other companies and are not measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by Ind AS and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\n## 49. We cannot assure payment of dividends on the Equity Shares in the future.\n\nOur Company has adopted a formal dividend distribution policy on August 14, 2024. While we have in the past declared and paid dividends, our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend upon our future results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, sufficient profitability, working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements and other factors considered relevant by our Directors and Shareholders. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on factors that our Board deems relevant, including among others, profitable growth of our Company and specifically profits earned and available for distribution during the relevant fiscal, accumulated reserves including retained earnings past dividend pattern of our Company and the industry, liquidity position of our Company, capital expenditure to be incurred by our Company, accumulated reserves, liquidity position of our Company including its working capital requirements and debt servicing obligations. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be impacted by a number of factors such as economic environment, changes in the Government policies and regulatory provisions, inflation rates and any other relevant or material factor as may be deemed fit by our Board. Our ability to pay dividends may also be restricted under certain financing arrangements that we may enter into. We cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends on the Equity Shares at any point in the future.

As a consequence of any increased costs, our actual deployment of funds may be higher than our management estimates, for which we may require additional funding that we may not be able to arrange on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. We may also face delays or incur additional costs due to failure to receive regulatory approvals, technical difficulties, human resource, technological or other resource constraints, or for other unforeseen reasons, events or circumstances.

These estimates may be inaccurate, and we may require additional funds to implement the purposes of the Offer. Accordingly, at this stage, we cannot determine with any certainty if we will require the Net Proceeds to meet any other expenditure or fund any exigencies arising out of the competitive environment, business conditions, economic conditions or other factors beyond our control.

Economic growth in India is affected by various factors including:\n\n- domestic consumption and savings, and prevailing income conditions among consumers and corporations in India;\n- any increase in Indian interest rates or inflation;\n- political instability, terrorism or military conflict in India or in countries in the region or globally, including in India's various neighboring countries;\n- any scarcity of credit or other financing in India, resulting in an adverse impact on economic conditions in India and scarcity of financing for our expansions;\n- volatility in, and actual or perceived trends in trading activity on India's principal stock exchanges;\n- changes in India's tax, trade, fiscal or monetary policies;\n- balance of trade movements, namely export demand and movements in key imports;\n- any downgrading of India's debt rating by a domestic or international rating agency;\n- financial instability in financial markets;\n- global economic uncertainty and liquidity crisis and volatility in exchange currency rates; and\n- other significant regulatory or economic developments in or affecting India or its waste treatment industry.\n\nConsequently, any future slowdown in the Indian economy could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Also, a change in the government or a change in the economic and deregulation policies could adversely affect economic conditions prevalent in the areas in which we operate in general and our business in particular and high rates of inflation in India could increase our costs without proportionately increasing our revenues, and as such decrease our operating margins.\n\nTo date, we have not experienced any material interruptions in our business operations in connection with these conflicts. We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the conflict in Ukraine as the conflict, and any resulting government reactions, are rapidly developing and beyond our control. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have a substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. Any of the abovementioned factors could affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\n\n## 61. We may be affected by competition law in India and any adverse application or interpretation of the Competition Act could in turn adversely affect our business and cash flows.\n\nThe Competition Act was enacted for the purpose of preventing practices that have or are likely to have an adverse effect on competition in India and has mandated the Competition Commission of India to regulate such practices. Under the Competition Act, any arrangement, understanding or action, whether formal or informal, which causes or is likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition is void and attracts substantial penalties.\n\nFurther, any agreement among competitors which, directly or indirectly, involves determination of purchase or sale prices, limits or controls production, or shares the market by way of geographical area or number of subscribers in the relevant market is presumed to have an appreciable adverse effect in the relevant market in India and shall be void. The Competition Act also prohibits abuse of a dominant position by any enterprise. On March 4, 2011, the Central Government notified and brought into force the Competition Commission of India (Procedure", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 77, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "in regard to the transaction of business relating to combinations) Regulations (\"Combination Regulations\") under the Competition Act with effect from June 1, 2011. The Combination Regulations require acquisitions of shares, voting rights, assets or control or mergers or amalgamations that cross the prescribed asset and turnover based thresholds to be mandatorily notified to, and pre-approved by, the Competition Commission of India. Additionally, on May 11, 2011, the Competition Commission of India issued the Competition Commission of India (Procedure for Transaction of Business Relating to Combinations) Regulations, 2011, which sets out the mechanism for implementation of the merger control regime in India. The Competition Act aims to, among other things, prohibit all agreements and transactions which may have an appreciable adverse effect in India. Consequently, all agreements entered into by us could be within the purview of the Competition Act. Further, the Competition Commission of India has extraterritorial powers and can investigate any agreements, abusive conduct or combination occurring outside of India if such agreement, conduct or combination has an appreciable adverse effect in India. We do not have any outstanding notices in relation to non-compliance with the Competition Act or the agreements entered into by us.\n\nThe Government of India has also introduced the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2023 in the Lok Sabha on February 8, 2023, which has proposed several amendments to Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2022 introduced in the Lok Sabha in August, 2022 and the Competition Act. These amendments include the introduction of deal value thresholds for assessing whether a merger or acquisition qualifies as a \"combination\", expedited merger review timelines, codification of the lowest standard of \"control\" and enhanced penalties for providing false information or a failure to provide material information. As these are draft amendments, we cannot ascertain at this stage whether the proposed amendments will come into force in the form suggested or at all, their applicability, partially or at all, in respect of our operations once they come into force, or the extent to which the amendments, if and when they come into force, will result in additional costs for compliance, which in turn may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\n\nHowever, if we are affected, directly or indirectly, by the application or interpretation of any provision of the Competition Act, or any enforcement proceedings initiated by the Competition Commission of India, or any adverse publicity that may be generated due to scrutiny or prosecution by the Competition Commission of India or if any prohibition or substantial penalties are levied under the Competition Act, it would adversely affect our business and cash flows.\n\n# 62. Changing laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties, including adverse application of tax laws, may adversely affect our business, prospects and results of operations. \n\nThe regulatory and policy environment in which we operate is evolving and subject to change. Unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new, laws, rules and regulations governing our business and operations could result in us being deemed to be in contravention of such laws and may require us to apply for additional approvals.\n\nWe cannot predict the impact of any changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of, new laws, rules, and regulations applicable to us and our business. Unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations including foreign investment and stamp duty laws governing our business and operations could result in us, our business, operations, or group structure being deemed to be in contravention of such laws and/or may require us to apply for additional approvals. We may incur increased costs and expend resources relating to compliance with such new requirements, which may also require significant management time, and any failure to comply may adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. Uncertainty in the applicability, interpretation, or implementation of any amendment to, or change in, governing law, regulation or policy, including by reason of an absence, or a limited body, of administrative or judicial precedent may be time consuming as well as costly for us to resolve and may impact the viability of our current business or restrict our ability to grow our business in the future.\n\n## 63. Under Indian law, foreign investors are subject to investment restrictions that limit our ability to attract foreign investors, which may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares.\n\nUnder foreign exchange regulations currently in force in India, transfer of shares between non-residents and residents are freely permitted (subject to compliance with sectoral norms and certain other exceptions), if they comply with the pricing guidelines and reporting requirements specified by the RBI. If a transfer of shares, which are sought to be transferred, is not in compliance with such requirements and fall under any of the exceptions specified by the RBI, then the RBI's prior approval is required. Additionally, shareholders who seek to convert Rupee proceeds from a sale of shares in India into foreign currency and repatriate that foreign currency from India require a no-objection or a tax clearance certificate from the Indian income tax authorities. We cannot assure you that any required approval", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 78, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "from the RBI or any other governmental agency can be obtained on any particular terms or at all.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Press Note No. 3 (2020 Series), dated April 17, 2020, issued by the DPIIT, which has been incorporated as the proviso to Rule 6(a) of the FEMA Rules, investments where the beneficial owner of the equity shares is situated in or is a citizen of a country which shares a land border with India, can only be made through the Government approval route, as prescribed in the Consolidated FDI Policy dated October 15, 2020 and the FEMA Rules. Further, in the event of transfer of ownership of any existing or future foreign direct investment in an entity in India, directly or indirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the aforesaid restriction / purview, such subsequent change in the beneficial ownership will also require approval of the Government of India. These investment restrictions shall also apply to subscribers of offshore derivative instruments. We cannot assure investors that any required approval from the RBI or any other governmental agency can be obtained on any particular terms or conditions or at all. For further information, see \"Restrictions on Foreign Ownership of Indian Securities\" on page 540.\n\n# 64. Rights of shareholders under Indian laws may be more limited than under the laws of other jurisdictions. \n\nIndian legal principles related to corporate procedures, directors' fiduciary duties and liabilities, and shareholders' rights may differ from those that would apply to a company in another jurisdiction. Shareholders' rights including in relation to class actions, under Indian law may not be as extensive as shareholders' rights under the laws of other countries or jurisdictions. Investors may have more difficulty in asserting their rights as shareholder in an Indian company than as shareholder of a corporation in another jurisdiction.\n\n## 65. Significant differences exist between Ind AS and other accounting principles, such as US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), which investors may be more familiar with and consider material to their assessment of our financial condition.\n\nOur Restated Consolidated Financial Information are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and the years ended March 31, 2024, March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, prepared in accordance with Ind AS, and all restated in accordance with requirements of Section 26 of Part I of Chapter III of Companies Act, SEBI ICDR Regulations, and the Guidance Note on \"Reports in Company Prospectuses (Revised 2019)\" issued by ICAI. Ind AS differs in certain significant respects from IFRS, U.S. GAAP and other accounting principles with which prospective investors may be familiar in other countries. We have not attempted to quantify the impact of US GAAP, IFRS or any other system of accounting principles on the financial data included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, nor do we provide a reconciliation of our financial statements to those of US GAAP, IFRS or any other accounting principles. US GAAP and IFRS differ in significant respects from Ind AS and Indian GAAP. Accordingly, the degree to which the Restated Consolidated Financial Information included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus will provide meaningful information is entirely dependent on the reader's level of familiarity with Ind AS, the Companies Act and the SEBI ICDR Regulations. Any reliance by persons not familiar with Indian accounting practices on the financial disclosures presented in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus should accordingly be limited.\n\n## 66. Annualized financial data contained in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus may not reflect our future performance.\n\nWe have presented certain data on an annualized basis (\"Annualized Financial Data\") in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. These calculations do not take into account seasonality factors or any other factor which could impact quarter-on-quarter or period-on-period variations, and may not reflect our actual performance for the period presented. The presentation of Annualized Financial Data are not standard measures under Ind AS and should not be considered in isolation or construed as alternatives to net income / loss, cash flow or any other measure of financial performance or indicators of our operating performance, liquidity, profitability or cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities. Annualized Financial Data presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\n## 67. Pursuant to listing of the Equity Shares, we may be subject to pre-emptive surveillance measures like Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) and Graded Surveillance Measures (GSM) by the Stock Exchanges in order to enhance market integrity and safeguard the interest of investors.\n\nSEBI and the Stock Exchanges have introduced various pre-emptive surveillance measures in order to enhance market integrity and safeguard the interests of investors, including ASM and GSM. ASM and GSM are imposed on securities of companies based on various objective criteria such as significant variations in price and volume, concentration of certain client accounts as a percentage of combined trading volume, average delivery, securities", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 79, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "which witness abnormal price rise not commensurate with financial health and fundamentals such as earnings, book value, fixed assets, net worth, price / earnings multiple and market capitalization.\n\nUpon listing, the trading of our Equity Shares would be subject to differing market conditions as well as other factors which may result in high volatility in price, low trading volumes, and a large concentration of client accounts as a percentage of combined trading volume of our Equity Shares. The occurrence of any of the abovementioned factors or other circumstances may trigger any of the parameters prescribed by SEBI and the Stock Exchanges for placing our securities under the GSM and/or ASM framework or any other surveillance measures, which could result in significant restrictions on trading of our Equity Shares being imposed by SEBI and the Stock Exchanges. These restrictions may include requiring higher margin requirements, requirement of settlement on a trade for trade basis without netting off, limiting trading frequency, reduction of applicable price band, requirement of settlement on gross basis or freezing of price on upper side of trading, as well as mentioning of our Equity Shares on the surveillance dashboards of the Stock Exchanges. The imposition of these restrictions and curbs on trading may have an adverse effect on market price, trading and liquidity of our Equity Shares and on the reputation and conditions of our Company.\n\n# 68. The determination of the Price Band is based on various factors and assumptions and the Offer Price of the Equity Shares may not be indicative of the market price of the Equity Shares upon listing on the Stock Exchanges. \n\nThe determination of the Price Band and discount, if any, shall be based on various factors and assumptions, and will be determined by our Company, in consultation with the Book Running Lead Managers. Furthermore, the Offer Price of the Equity Shares shall be determined by our Company, in consultation with the Book Running Lead Managers through the Book Building Process. These shall be based on numerous factors, including those described under \"Basis for Offer Price\" on page 155, and may not be indicative of the market price of the Equity Shares upon listing on the Stock Exchanges.\n\nThe price of our Equity Shares upon listing on the Stock Exchanges will be determined by the market and may be influenced by many factors outside of our control. For further details, see \"- Our Equity Shares have never been publicly traded, and after the Offer, the Equity Shares may experience price and volume fluctuations, and an active trading market for the Equity Shares may not develop. Further, the current market price of some securities listed pursuant to initial public offerings which were managed by the Book Running Lead Managers in the past, is below their respective issue prices\" on page 81.\n\n## 69. As a publicly listed company, we will be subject to additional compliance requirements and increased scrutiny. Further, the majority of our Directors are not directors in any listed entities, which may affect our ability to meet such additional compliance requirements.\n\nWe are not a publicly listed company and have not historically been subject to increased scrutiny by shareholders, regulators and the public at large that is associated with being a listed company. As a listed company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, corporate governance and other expenses that we did not incur as an unlisted company. Further, we will need to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal controls over financial reporting, including keeping adequate records of daily transactions. In order to do this, significant resources and management attention will be required. Additionally, our Directors, except for Chandrakant Vallabhaji Gogri and Neha Rajen Gada, are not directors in any listed entities. Consequently, additional management attention may be required to ensure compliance with the requirements associated with publicly listed companies. Further, we may need to hire additional personnel with appropriate experience and technical knowledge to ensure that we meet these additional requirements, which may require us to incur additional expenses. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire such personal in a timely or efficient manner.\n70. Our Equity Shares have never been publicly traded, and after the Offer, the Equity Shares may experience price and volume fluctuations, and an active trading market for the Equity Shares may not develop. Further, the current market price of some securities listed pursuant to initial public offerings which were managed by the Book Running Lead Managers in the past, is below their respective issue prices.\n\nPrior to the Offer, there has been no public market for the Equity Shares, and an active trading market for our Equity Share on the Stock Exchanges may not develop or be sustained after the Offer. Listing and quotation do not guarantee that a market for the Equity Shares will develop, or if developed, the liquidity of such market for the Equity Shares.\n\nIn addition to the above, the current market price of securities listed pursuant to certain previous initial public", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 80, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "offerings managed by the Book Running Lead Managers may be below their respective issue price. For further details, see \"Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures - Price information of past issues handled by the Book Running Lead Managers\" on page 498. The market price of the Equity Shares may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other factors, the failure of security analysts to cover the Equity Shares after this Offer, or changes in the estimates of our performance by analysts, the activities of competitors and suppliers, future sales of the Equity Shares by our Company or our shareholders, variations in our operating results of our Company, market conditions specific to the industry we operate in, developments relating to India, volatility in securities markets in jurisdictions other than India, variations in the growth rate of financial indicators, variations in revenue or earnings estimates by research publications, and changes in economic, legal and other regulatory factors. We cannot assure you that an active market will develop, or sustained trading will take place in the Equity Shares or provide any assurance regarding the price at which the Equity Shares will be traded after listing.\n\nIn addition, the stock market often experiences price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of the Equity Shares, regardless of our Company's performance.

For details on such allotments, see \"Capital Structure\" on page 103.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 81, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# 73. Investors may be subject to Indian taxes applicable on income arising from distribution of dividend and sale of the Equity Shares. \n\nUnder current Indian tax laws, unless specifically exempted, capital gains arising from the sale of equity shares in an Indian company is generally taxable in India. Investors may be subject to payment of long-term or short-term capital gains tax in India, in addition to payment of Securities Transaction Tax (\"STT\"), on the sale of any Equity Shares held for more or less than 12 months immediately preceding the date of transfer. While non-residents may claim tax treaty benefits in relation to such capital gains income, generally, Indian tax treaties do not limit India's right to impose a tax on capital gains arising from the sale of shares of an Indian company.\n\nIn terms of the Finance Act, 2018, with effect from April 1, 2018, taxes payable by an assessee on the capital gains arising from transfer of long-term capital assets (introduced as Section 112A of the Income-Tax Act, 1961) shall be calculated on such long-term capital gains at the rate of $12.5 \\%$ (plus applicable surcharge and cess), where the longterm capital gains exceed $\u20b9 125,000$, subject to certain exceptions in case of resident individuals and Hindu Undivided Families. The stamp duty for transfer of certain securities, other than debentures, on a delivery basis is currently specified at $0.015 \\%$ and on a non-delivery basis is specified at $0.003 \\%$ of the consideration amount.\n\nUnder the Finance Act 2020, any dividends paid by an Indian company will be subject to tax in the hands of the shareholders at applicable rates. Such taxes will be withheld by the Indian company paying dividends. The Company may or may not grant the benefit of a tax treaty (where applicable) to a non-resident shareholder for the purposes of deducting tax at source pursuant to any corporate action including dividends. Investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors and to carefully consider the potential tax consequences of owning Equity Shares. Unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new, laws, rules and regulations including foreign investment and stamp duty laws governing our business and operations could result in us being deemed to be in contravention of such laws and may require us to apply for additional approvals.\n\n## 74. QIBs and Non-Institutional Investors are not permitted to withdraw or lower their Bids (in terms of quantity of Equity Shares or the Bid Amount) at any stage after submitting a Bid, and Retail Individual Investors are not permitted to withdraw their Bids after Bid / Offer Closing Date.\n\nPursuant to the SEBI ICDR Regulations, QIBs and Non-Institutional Investors are required to pay the Bid Amount on submission of the Bid and are not permitted to withdraw or lower their Bids (in terms of quantity of Equity Shares or the Bid Amount) at any stage after submitting a Bid. However, Retail Individual Investors can revise their Bids during the Bid / Offer Period and withdraw their Bids until Bid / Offer Closing Date. While our Company is required to complete all necessary formalities for listing and commencement of trading of the Equity Shares on all Stock Exchanges where such Equity Shares are proposed to be listed including Allotment pursuant to the Offer within such period as may be prescribed under applicable law, events affecting the Bidders' decision to invest in the Equity Shares, including adverse changes in international or national monetary policy, financial, political or economic conditions, our business, results of operation or financial condition may arise between the date of submission of the Bid and Allotment. Our Company may complete the Allotment of the Equity Shares even if such events occur, and such events limit the Bidders' ability to sell the Equity Shares Allotted pursuant to the Offer or cause the trading price of the Equity Shares to decline on listing.\n\n## 75. Holders of Equity Shares could be restricted in their ability to exercise pre-emptive rights under Indian law and could thereby suffer future dilution of their ownership position.\n\nUnder the Companies Act, a company having share capital and incorporated in India must offer holders of its Equity Shares pre-emptive rights to subscribe and pay for a proportionate number of Equity Shares to maintain their existing ownership percentages prior to the issuance of any new equity shares, unless the pre-emptive rights have been waived by the adoption of a special resolution. However, if the laws of the jurisdiction that you are in does not permit the exercise of such pre-emptive rights without our filing an offering document or registration statement with the applicable authority in such jurisdiction, you will be unable to exercise such pre-emptive rights unless we make such a filing. To the extent that you are unable to exercise pre-emptive rights granted in respect of the Equity Shares, you may suffer future dilution of your ownership position and your proportional interests in our Company would be reduced.\n\n## 76. Future issuances or sales of Equity Shares, or convertible securities or other equity-linked securities could adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares.\n\nOur future issuances of Equity Shares, convertible securities or securities linked to the Equity Shares by us (including", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 82, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "under employee stock option plans) or the disposal of Equity Shares by our Promoter or any of our other principal shareholders or the perception that such issuance or sales may occur, including to comply with the minimum public shareholding norms applicable to listed companies in India, may significantly affect the trading price of the Equity Shares and our ability to raise capital through an issue of our securities. There can be no assurance that we will not issue further Equity Shares or that the shareholders will not dispose of, pledge or otherwise encumber the Equity Shares. Any future issuances could also dilute the value of your investment in our Company.\n\n# 77. Fluctuation in the exchange rate of the Rupee and other currencies could have an adverse effect on the value of our Equity Shares, independent of our operating results. \n\nSubject to requisite approvals, on listing, our Equity Shares will be quoted in Rupees on the Stock Exchanges. Any dividends, if declared, in respect of our Equity Shares will be paid in Rupees and subsequently converted into the relevant foreign currency for repatriation, if required. Any adverse movement in exchange rates during the time that it takes to undertake such conversion may reduce the net dividend to such investors. In addition, any adverse movement in exchange rates during a delay in repatriating the proceeds from a sale of Equity Shares outside India, for example, because of a delay in regulatory approvals that may be required for the sale of Equity Shares may reduce the net proceeds received by shareholders.\n\nThe exchange rate of the Rupee has changed substantially in the last two decades and could fluctuate substantially in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on the value of the Equity Shares and returns from the Equity Shares, independent of our operating results.\n\n## 78. Investors will not be able to sell immediately on an Indian stock exchange any of the Equity Shares they purchase in the Offer.\n\nSubject to requisite approvals, the Equity Shares will be listed on the Stock Exchanges. Pursuant to applicable Indian laws, certain actions must be completed before the Equity Shares can be listed and trading in the Equity Shares may commence. Investors' book entry, or 'demat' accounts with depository participants in India, are expected to be credited within one working day of the date on which the Basis of Allotment is approved by the Stock Exchanges. The Allotment of Equity Shares in this Offer and the credit of such Equity Shares to the applicant's demat account with depository participant could take approximately two Working Days from the Bid Closing Date and trading in the Equity Shares upon receipt of final listing and trading approvals from the Stock Exchanges is expected to commence within three Working Days of the Bid Closing Date. There could be a failure or delay in listing of the Equity Shares on the Stock Exchanges. Any failure or delay in obtaining the approval or otherwise commence trading in the Equity Shares would restrict investors' ability to dispose of their Equity Shares. There can be no assurance that the Equity Shares will be credited to investors' demat accounts, or that trading in the Equity Shares will commence, within the time periods specified in this risk factor. We could also be required to pay interest at the applicable rates if allotment is not made, refund orders are not dispatched or demat credits are not made to investors within the prescribed time periods.

For Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2024 the Company had trade receivable days of 105 days, 158 days and 197 days respectively. For the three months period ended June 30, 2024, the trade receivables days was 297 days since as a trend the Company has lower revenue during the 1st quarter of the Fiscal. As the company's revenues from operations have been increasing over the past 3 years the historical trade receivable days have increased from 105 days in Fiscal 2022 to 197 days in Fiscal 2024 on account of growing trend in revenue primarily during the 4th quarter of the Fiscal. The Company expects this range of receivable days to continue and has assumed trade receivable days of 197 days for Fiscal 2026 and Fiscal 2027. |\n| Inventories | Inventory days is basis assumptions on cost of goods sold.

For the three months period ended June 30, 2024, the inventories days was 220 days as the Company maintains requisite inventory level for the entire Fiscal while the revenue as a trend happens to be lower during the 1st quarter of the Fiscal.

The decline in other current asset days from 18 days in Fiscal 2022 to 5 days in Fiscal 2024 is primarily attributable to utilization/recovery of credits/balances with government authorities pertaining to various duties and taxes. For the three months period ended June 30, 2024, the other current assets days was 25 days.

The increase in trade payable days from 102 days in Fiscal 2022 to 134 days in Fiscal 2024 is attributable to increasing shares of last quarter's purchases coupled with increasing inventory levels which is in line with the increase trend in revenue during the last quarter of the Fiscal. For the three months period ended June 30, 2024 the trade payables days was 206 days since as a trend the Company has lower Cost of Goods sold which is in line with lower revenue during the $1^{\\text {st }}$ quarter of the Fiscal.

Economic activity slowed from CY2018 and entered a recession in CY2020 due to the pandemic, which brought many economies to a near standstill through CY2020 and part of CY2021 as countries imposed strict restrictions. The global economy rebounded in CY2021, showing strong growth, but encountered new challenges in CY2022, including the Russia-Ukraine war, inflation, slowdowns in the US and Europe, and supply chain disruptions. By CY2023, global real GDP growth stabilised at $3.3 \\%$, and it is expected to maintain similar pace over the next three years before slowing to $3.1 \\%$ in CY2028E. However, this outlook is subject to risks from higher interest rates implemented by central banks to control inflation and reduced government spending due to accumulated debt.\n\nExhibit 1.1: Real GDP Growth - Historic and Forecast, World, CY2018 - CY2028E\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 180, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "Exhibit 1.2: Real GDP Growth by Select Regions \\& Countries - Historic and Forecast, World, CY2018 CY2028E\n\n| Country / Region | CY2018 | CY2019 | CY2020 | CY2021 | CY2022 | CY2023 | CY2024E | CY2025E | CY2026E | CY2027E | CY2028E |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| World | 3.6\\% | 2.9\\% | $-2.7 \\%$ | 6.6\\% | 3.6\\% | 3.3\\% | 3.2\\% | 3.2\\% | 3.3\\% | 3.2\\% | 3.1\\% |\n| United States | 3.0\\% | 2.6\\% | $-2.2 \\%$ | 6.1\\% | 2.5\\% | 2.9\\% | 2.8\\% | 2.2\\% | 2.0\\% | 2.1\\% | 2.1\\% |\n| China | 6.7\\% | 6.0\\% | 2.2\\% | 8.4\\% | 3.0\\% | 5.2\\% | 4.8\\% | 4.5\\% | 4.1\\% | 3.6\\% | 3.4\\% |\n| India | 6.5\\% | 3.9\\% | $-5.8 \\%$ | 9.7\\% | 7.0\\% | 8.2\\% | 7.0\\% | 6.5\\% | 6.5\\% | 6.5\\% | 6.5\\% |\n| North America | 2.8\\% | 2.2\\% | $-3.0 \\%$ | 6.0\\% | 2.7\\% | 2.8\\% | 2.5\\% | 2.1\\% | 2.0\\% | 2.1\\% | 2.1\\% |\n| Europe | 2.3\\% | 2.0\\% | $-5.4 \\%$ | 6.4\\% | 2.4\\% | 1.2\\% | 1.6\\% | 1.6\\% | 1.7\\% | 1.6\\% | 1.6\\% |\n| Asia and Pacific | 5.3\\% | 4.2\\% | $-0.8 \\%$ | 7.1\\% | 4.1\\% | 4.9\\% | 4.5\\% | 4.4\\% | 4.3\\% | 4.1\\% | 4.0\\% |\n| Middle East and Central Asia | 2.7\\% | 1.9\\% | $-2.2 \\%$ | 4.4\\% | 5.5\\% | 2.1\\% | 2.4\\% | 3.9\\% | 4.2\\% | 3.9\\% | 3.8\\% |\n| Africa | 3.4\\% | 3.1\\% | $-1.4 \\%$ | 4.7\\% | 4.3\\% | 3.3\\% | 3.0\\% | 4.2\\% | 4.4\\% | 4.3\\% | 4.4\\% |\n| Latin America and Caribbean | 1.1\\% | 0.2\\% | $-6.9 \\%$ | 7.4\\% | 4.2\\% | 2.2\\% | 2.1\\% | 2.5\\% | 2.7\\% | 2.8\\% | 2.7\\% |\n\nSource: IMF October 2024 forecast, Frost \\& Sullivan analysis\n\n# Inflation \n\nGlobal inflation eased from $8.6 \\%$ in CY2022 to $6.7 \\%$ in CY2023 and is expected to decline further to $5.8 \\%$ in CY2024, driven by tighter monetary policies and lower international commodity prices. However, core inflation is expected to decline more slowly, likely delaying a return to target levels until CY2025. With disinflation and steady growth, the risk of a significant economic slowdown has diminished, and global growth risks are balanced. Faster disinflation could ease financial conditions, while stronger structural reforms could boost productivity. However, potential risks include new commodity price spikes from geopolitical shocks, persistent inflation, property sector issues in China, and disruptive fiscal policies that could hinder growth.\n\nExhibit 1.3: Inflation Rate - Historic and Forecast, World, CY2018 - CY2028E\n\n| Country / Region | CY2018 | CY2019 | CY2020 | CY2021 | CY2022 | CY2023 | CY2024E | CY2025E | CY2026E | CY2027E | CY2028E |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| World | 3.6\\% | 3.5\\% | 3.3\\% | 4.7\\% | 8.6\\% | 6.7\\% | 5.8\\% | 4.3\\% | 3.6\\% | 3.4\\% | 3.3\\% |\n| United States | 2.4\\% | 1.8\\% | 1.2\\% | 4.7\\% | 8.0\\% | 4.1\\% | 3.0\\% | 1.9\\% | 2.1\\% | 2.1\\% | 2.1\\% |\n| China | 2.1\\% | 2.9\\% | 2.5\\% | 0.9\\% | 2.0\\% | 0.2\\% | 0.4\\% | 1.7\\% | 2.0\\% | 2.0\\% | 2.0\\% |\n| India | 3.4\\% | 4.8\\% | 6.2\\% | 5.5\\% | 6.7\\% | 5.4\\% | 4.4\\% | 4.1\\% | 4.1\\% | 4.0\\% | 4.0\\% |\n| North America | 2.7\\% | 2.0\\% | 1.4\\% | 4.7\\% | 7.9\\% | 4.2\\% | 3.1\\% | 2.0\\% | 2.1\\% | 2.2\\% | 2.2\\% |\n| Europe | 2.2\\% | 2.0\\% | 1.2\\% | 3.6\\% | 10.0\\% | 6.3\\% | 3.5\\% | 3.0\\% | 2.5\\% | 2.4\\% | 2.4\\% |\n| Asia and Pacific | 3.1\\% | 3.4\\% | 3.2\\% | 3.0\\% | 6.3\\% | 4.9\\% | 4.4\\% | 3.8\\% | 3.4\\% | 3.2\\% | 3.2\\% |\n| Middle East \\& Central Asia | 9.6\\% | 7.4\\% | 10.3\\% | 11.9\\% | 13.4\\% | 15.6\\% | 14.6\\% | 10.7\\% | 8.5\\% | 7.3\\% | 6.6\\% |\n| Africa | 11.4\\% | 9.4\\% | 11.1\\% | 12.3\\% | 14.2\\% | 18.2\\% | 20.3\\% | 13.9\\% | 9.2\\% | 8.0\\% | 6.9\\% |\n| Latin America and Caribbean | 6.7\\% | 7.6\\% | 6.5\\% | 9.9\\% | 14.2\\% | 14.8\\% | 16.8\\% | 8.5\\% | 5.7\\% | 4.4\\% | 3.7\\% |\n\nSource: IMF October 2024 forecast, Frost \\& Sullivan analysis\n\n## Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)\n\nIndia led with its PMI of 57.5, while the U.S. PMI fell from 51.9 to 48.5 .

The government is driving structural reforms to position India as a global manufacturing hub, with a proposed capex outlay of INR 11.11 trillion for FY2025, a 17\\% year-on-year increase. Key development priorities, termed \"Saptarishi,\" focus on inclusive growth, infrastructure, economic potential, sustainable development, youth empowerment, and financial sector strength. Initially aiming to become a USD 5 trillion economy by FY2025, India's timeline was extended due to COVID-19. The Nominal GDP is expected to surpass USD 4 trillion by FY2025 and reach USD 5 trillion by 2027-2028, making India the third-largest economy globally.\n\n## Review and outlook of Real GDP growth in India\n\nThe Indian government launched a comprehensive strategy to revive the economy post-COVID-19, combining immediate relief with long-term growth initiatives. Stimulus packages provided crucial financial support to vulnerable groups and businesses. Infrastructure projects like the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan aimed to create jobs and enhance logistics. Reforms in agriculture, labor, and other sectors were introduced to boost efficiency and unlock economic potential. The government's focus on green growth and youth empowerment reflects its commitment to a sustainable, future-proof economy. These efforts, alongside stable domestic demand and private investments are expected to drive a $7.0 \\%$ CAGR between FY2025E and FY2028E.\n\nExhibit 2.1: Annual Real GDP and growth, value in INR trillion, India, FY2018 - FY2029E", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 182, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "![img-10.jpeg](img-10.jpeg)\n\n# Index of Industrial Production (IIP) \n\nPost-pandemic, since June 2021, industrial activity in the country started picking up and continued its momentum through FY2022 - FY2024 with industrial output recording a sharp growth across all the four constituent sectors in the last three consecutive years.

The PMI reached a peak of 58.7 in May 2023, reflecting strong demand, with output and new orders surging. However, it fell to an 18-month low of 54.9 in December 2023 due to weaker demand and lower output, before rebounding to 59.2 in March 2024.\n\n# Sectoral share of Gross Value Added (GVA) \n\nThe Gross Value Added of India has grown steadily since suffering a decline of $4.5 \\%$ in FY2021.

As per first advance estimates, the manufacturing GVA is expected to reach INR 27.9 trillion by FY2024 at an annual growth of $6.5 \\%$. One of the key reasons for this healthy growth is the government's vision of making India a global manufacturing hub. Indian manufacturing sector's contribution has increased from $16 \\%$ to $17 \\%$ buoyed by initiatives like Make in India, Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes and sector-specific initiatives that aim to make India a global manufacturing destination.\n\n# Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) \n\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI) in India has significantly increased in the last few years on the backdrop of improved 'Ease of Doing Business' ranking and proactive manufacturing policies from the Indian Government. The country received a record USD 434.9 billion FDI between FY2018 and FY2023.\n\nExhibit 2.7: FDI inflow in India, in USD billion, FY2018 - FY2024\n![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)\n\nSource: RBI, Frost \\& Sullivan Analysis", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 185, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "FDI reached a record USD 84.8 billion in FY2022 - the highest FDI in any fiscal year to date. Even though the FDI declined to USD 71.4 billion in FY2023, it is still at par with the last 6 year's average FDI in the country - India has achieved this feat despite the Indian government's restrictions on FDI from China. In FY2024, India has registered a gross FDI inflow of USD 71.0 billion. Despite high interest rates across the globe, India's FDI inflows remained steady as compared to its peer developing economies, because of the 'demand strength' of the economy.\n\n# Per capita income - India vs. leading global economies \n\nPer capita income is a broad indicator of the prosperity of an economy. Consumer confidence and discretionary consumption both improve with the rising per capita income. India's per capita income in CY2023 was USD 2,500 (at current price) and is considered a lower middle-income country.\n\nFor India to become a middle-income country, its per capita income needs to grow by almost 2.3 times to USD 6,100. Even though India's per capita income grew by almost $100 \\%$ since FY2015, wealth distribution among India's 1.4 billion people remains highly skewed. Equitable access to healthcare, quality education, and jobs would be critical for India to deliver sustained growth in per capita income. Global average per capita income in CY2023 was 5.1 times higher than India at USD 13,359. CY2023 per capita income of USA, Europe, and China was USD 81,632, USD 32,415 , and USD 12,514 respectively.\n\nIndia in the last few years has seen a significant expansion of middle-class households. Robust economic development, growing population, relatively slower aging, and rising income levels coupled with urbanization would result in nearly 400 million additional middle-class and high-income population being added to the country's economy by FY2031 effectively pushing the share of upper middle class and high-income earners to nearly $58 \\%$ of the population by FY2031 - this in turn would drive the growth in per capita income of the country.\n\nExhibit 2.8: India vs. Global - Per capita income of India vs leading economies\n(USA, China, Europe and Southeast Asia), value in USD, CY2018 - CY2028E\n![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)\n\n## Per capita electricity consumption\n\nPower-intensive industries, the purchasing power of the average citizen, household size, and general power efficiency standards all contribute to the amount of electricity that is consumed per person every year. However, a country's size and population can also play an important role.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 186, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "Exhibit 2.9: Per capita electricity consumption of global leading economies vs India, in kWh, CY2022\n![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg)\n\nAmong the top 10 global economies, per capita electricity consumption is the highest for the USA whereas, it is the lowest for India - 1,297 kWh, approximately one-third of the global average of $3,664 \\mathrm{kWh}$ at the end of CY2022. India's per capita electricity consumption has steadily increased from $1,149 \\mathrm{kWh}$ in FY2018 to $1,331 \\mathrm{kWh}$ in FY2023. Per capita electricity consumption has grown at a healthy pace of $8.1 \\%$ and $6.1 \\%$ in FY2022 and FY2023. The reasons for such an increase include electrification of the villages, heightened economic and manufacturing activities, and increasing penetration of various consumer durables products. Considering a historical average multiplier of 0.8 with the GDP growth, per capital electricity consumption may cross $1,700 \\mathrm{kWh}$ by FY2028 and may touch 2,000 kWh by FY2031.\n\nExhibit 2.10: Per capita electricity consumption of India and growth, in kWh and \\%, FY2018 - FY2031E\n![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg)\n\nThe government of India launched Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) in December 2014 for the rural areas with the objective of electrification of all un-electrified villages as per Census 2011. Similarly, Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA) was launched in October 2017 with the objective to achieve universal household electrification by providing electricity connections to all un-electrified households in rural areas and all poor households in urban areas of the country. For DDUGJY, the total allocation was \u20b944,033 crore, with significant progress made in the electrification of villages and households. These programmes have successfully electrified nearly all households across the length and breadth of the country. 100\\% of urban households and 99.3\\% of Indian rural households have access to electricity at the end of FY2022 as per a report from the World Bank.\n\n# INDIA EMERGING AS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURING HUB \n\nIndia emerging as a global manufacturing hub", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 187, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "In FY2024, India's merchandise exports reached USD 437 billion, with a goal of USD 1 trillion by 2030.

Projections show that by FY2029, sewage generation will reach 102,025 MLD, while processing capacity is expected to improve to 68,737 MLD, highlighting the need for continued investment to bridge the gap and meet environmental sustainability goals.\n\n# Exhibit 5.7(a): Sewage generation and treatment capacity in India, FY2015, FY2021 and FY2023 \n\n![img-35.jpeg](img-35.jpeg)\n\nSource: National Inventory of sewage treatment plants, Primary interview, Frost \\& Sullivan analysis\n\nThe data indicates a significant and consistent issue with the gap between sewage generation and processing capacity in India, yet it shows a promising trend of gradual improvement. From FY2015 to FY2029, sewage generation is projected to increase from 61,948 MLD to 102,025 MLD. Although installed treatment capacity is also projected to increase from 23,277 MLD in FY2015 to an estimated 68,737 MLD in FY2029, the gap between generated sewage and its processing remains substantial.\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that the gap is slowly narrowing over the years. In FY2015, the gap was 38,671 MLD, and it is projected to decrease to 33,288 MLD by FY2029. Additionally, the percentage of sewage processed has improved from $38 \\%$ in FY2015 to an expected $67 \\%$ by FY2029, indicating progressive strides towards enhancing sewage treatment infrastructure.\n\nExhibit 5.7 (b): Estimated sewage generation versus installed treatment capacity in India, FY2015 - FY2029E", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 203, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "![img-36.jpeg](img-36.jpeg)\n\nDespite these improvements, the persistent gap highlights the need for accelerated efforts in expanding sewage treatment facilities to keep pace with increasing urbanization and population growth.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) mandates that certain infrastructures, including apartments, commercial projects, educational institutions, townships, and area development projects, must have sewage treatment plants (STPs) if they meet specific conditions. The regulations cover STP site selection, technology, operation, and maintenance to ensure effective and safe operation. These rules aim to promote compliance while also providing financial incentives and penalties to regulate the industry.\n\n## The Technology of STP\n\n## The approved STP technologies are:\n\nSequential Batch Reactor (SBR) (Cyclic activated sludge technology (C-Tech) is the recent version of sequential batch reactor)\n\nActivated Sludge Process (ASP) (only when above 500 KLD sewage is generated).\nMembrane Bio Reactor (MBR)\n\n## Moving Bed Bio Reactor (MBBR)\n\n## Regulations:\n\nIn India, housing projects over 20,000 square metres in metro cities must install private sewage treatment plants (STPs) with builders responsible for installation and five years of maintenance. Regulations have evolved since 2015, with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) initially enforcing strict discharge rules, which were relaxed in 2017, leading to a decline in water quality. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) tightened these regulations in 2019, setting stricter standards for STPs on Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), pH, Total Suspended Solids, Nitrogen, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Fecal Coliform levels.\n\n## Incentive Structures for Investment and Participation:\n\nThe Indian government promotes sewage treatment investment through financial mechanisms like the Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) under the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG). The government covers $40 \\%$ of the capital cost, while developers cover $60 \\%$ and all operational costs, with repayment over 15 years. The \"one city, one operator\" concept is also used for efficient STP management.\n\n## Penalty for non-compliance:\n\nState governments impose penalties under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, capped at INR 5 lakhs, which may not deter violations. The NGT has fined states a total of approximately INR 301.8 billion for mismanagement of sewage and solid waste, including INR 80,000 crore for non-compliance. Major deficiencies include unmanaged liquid waste and legacy waste, with Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh receiving the highest penalties.\n\n## Exhibit 5.8: Key Regulatory Requirements", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 205, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "![img-39.jpeg](img-39.jpeg)\n\nExhibit 5.9: Total fine levied for non-compliance, by State\n\n| STATE | FINE (INR BILLION) |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Maharashtra | 120 |\n| Karnataka | 29 |\n| Rajasthan | 25 |\n| West Bengal | 25 |\n| Telangana | 25 |\n| Punjab | 20 |\n\n# Indian Government's vision and initiatives for sewage treatment infrastructure growth \n\nWhile there isn't a single, overarching national target for sewage treatment capacity growth in India, the government acknowledges the critical need for improvement.

The treated wastewater (TWW), in almost entirety, is either discharged to the watercourses or being used for irrigating parks, lawns or public places. Its reuse for non-potable purposes, such as crop irrigation, industrial processes, and groundwater recharge, is still relatively uncommon.\nOnly a small fraction of treated wastewater finds its way back into productive use, representing an untapped resource that could alleviate water scarcity concerns. As inferred from the inventory of STPs published by CPCB, just less than $1,000 \\mathrm{MLD}$, which is about $3 \\%$ of treated wastewater and $1 \\%$ of wastewater generated, is being reused for some valuable purposes.\n\nExhibit 5.19: Market potential for treated wastewater reuse, in India, in MCM, Per annum, FY2021 - FY2029E\n![img-44.jpeg](img-44.jpeg)\n\nExhibit 5.20: Potential market value of TWW, in INR Million, India, FY2021 - FY2029E", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 212, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "![img-45.jpeg](img-45.jpeg)\n\nNon-utilization of TWW is a waste of resources, the capital cost of the treatment facility, and the expense incurred in treating the used water. These factors are driving infrastructure development and stricter wastewater treatment regulations, positioning treated wastewater as a valuable resource. In FY2024, India had approximately 14,400 MCM of treated wastewater available for potential reuse. This is projected to rise to 15,288 MCM by FY2025 and 19,306 MCM by FY2029E. In FY2023, around 8,603 MCM of treated wastewater could have been reused in irrigation, potentially irrigating 1.38 million hectares of land, equivalent to nine times the area of New Delhi.\n\n# Additional economic benefits from the reuse of treated water \n\n## Reduction in fertilizer usage\n\nWastewater contains valuable nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, or NPK). Thus, reusing treated wastewater for irrigation can aid crop growth and reduce the demand for synthetic fertilizer use. This can lead to both environmental and economic benefits. the nutrients from currently available TWW for irrigation amount to more than 6,000 tonnes. On account of this inherent nutrient value, irrigation using TWW has the potential to reduce fertilizer usage by $9-10$ per cent.\n\n## Reduction in area irrigated by groundwater and GHG emissions\n\nIndia has a net irrigated area of 68.2 Mha , of which $60 \\%$ (about 39 Mha ) is irrigated through groundwater. The available treated wastewater would have the potential to irrigate 3 Mha by 2050. This would have reduced pumping in $3.5 \\%$ of the groundwater-irrigated area in FY2021, which will increase to $8 \\%$ by FY2050.\n\n## Overview of SBR technology\n\nThe Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) is a key wastewater treatment technology in India, representing about $28 \\%$ to $30 \\%$ of installed capacity for municipal and industrial plants. It treats wastewater in a single batch reactor, combining equalisation, aeration, clarification and nutrient removal (nitrogen and phosphorus). Wastewater is screened and grit is removed before entering a partially filled reactor with acclimated biomass. The reactor operates in batches, performing aeration and mixing, then allowing biomass to settle before removing treated water. Excess biomass is periodically removed to maintain the proper influent-to-biomass ratio. In continuous flow systems, this ratio is maintained by adjusting return activated sludge flowrates. After SBR treatment, the wastewater may flow to an equalisation basin for controlled flow to additional processes. In some cases, it is further filtered and disinfected.\n\nExhibit 5.21: Process flow diagram for a typical SBR", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 213, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "![img-46.jpeg](img-46.jpeg)\n\nThe SBR technology, though not entirely new, has seen a resurgence in recent decades due to its flexibility and efficiency.\n\n# Exhibit 5.22: Evolution of SBR technology \n\n![img-47.jpeg](img-47.jpeg)\n\n## Overview of C-Tech process\n\nC-Tech is the latest generation SBR process, employed extensively for treating both domestic sewage and industrial effluents to achieve recyclable quality water with low life cycle cost, and has installations in many countries, including UK, Germany, Poland, Austria, China, Russia, Australia, Vietnam and Malaysia. Unlike traditional SBR systems, CTECH uses two or more batch tanks in parallel, with their sequences out of phase, allowing continuous flow without the need for an upstream buffer tank. This design reduces the site footprint by approximately $50 \\%$.

The Company has achieved an average biogas yield of more than $150 \\mathrm{Nm}^{\\wedge} 3 /$ ton of organic waste in the North Goa Plant in the last financial year, higher than the industry average of $80-100 \\mathrm{Nm}^{\\wedge} 3 /$ ton.\n\nBy converting the digestate formed after the fermentation of organic fraction into high-quality compost, the process improves the marketability and price realization of the compost produced.\n\nThe Company has capability to recover higher proportion of recyclables than the industry average through their proprietary municipal solid waste processes\n\nBalance waste in the dry fraction (after recovery of recyclables), often referred to as refused derived fuel (\"RDF\"), has a calorific value approximately between 3,000 to $3,500 \\mathrm{Kcal} / \\mathrm{kg}$, making it a viable alternate fuel source for energy production or as a fuel (as replacement to coal) in cement plants.\n\nSFC is among the market leaders in the MSW space basis their operational results and comprehensive solutions. The company currently runs a 250 TPD Municipal Waste to Biogas plant in North Goa and a 125 TPD plant in South Goa. With around 8 years of operation, the plant in North Goa holds the distinction of being one of the longest-operating integrated SWT-based biogas plants in India.\n\nThe plant deploys the Company's proprietary OREX technology. OREX is SFC's proprietary innovation, designed to efficiently separate biodegradable organics from inorganic materials and lignocellulosic fibres from mixed municipal waste. OREX automatically segregates mixed municipal waste into organic (wet) and inorganic (dry) fractions in a single step reducing the need for manual oversight, translating into lower ongoing operational costs and promotion of reuse.\n\nOREX is a multi-stage system designed to extract maximum organics from the mixed waste and preparation of degritted organic slurry for downstream digesters resulting into homogenous pulped slurry having $>98 \\%$ biodegradable material, largely free of contaminants and non-biodegradable fractions which enhance the bio-methanization process inside digesters. This technology is particularly adept at processing the typical municipal solid waste found in India, which characteristically includes a diverse mix of bio-waste, inerts, textiles, glass, wood, metal, rubber, plastic, paper, and miscellaneous items.\n\nExhibit 6.6: Profile of leading Waste to Energy project developers in India, FY2024", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 228, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "|  |  |  | Waste Processing Technology |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Company Name | Year of incorporation | Waste C\\&T | CBG/Biomethanation | Incineration | Inorganic waste recycling | Waste Handling Capacity (TPO) | WTE Capacity (MW) | States where operational |\n| SFC Environmental Technologies | 2005 | (3) | (3) | (3) | (3) | 350 | 2.17 | South and North Goa |\n| RE Sustainability | 1994 | (3) | (3) | (3) | (3) | 13,500 | 68.5 | 13 states across India |\n| Ecogreen Energy | 2011 | (3) | (3) | (3) | (3) | 3,750 | 55 (proposed) | MP, UP, Haryana |\n| JITF Urban Infrastructure | 2007 | (3) | (3) | (3) | (3) | $\\sim 2,000$ | 23 | Delhi, Punjab |\n| Abellon CleanEnergy | 2008 | (3) | (3) | (3) | (3) | 3,100 | Current - 45 Upcoming - 65 | Gujarat |\n| Antony Lara Renewable Energy | 2018 | (3) | (3) | (3) | (3) | 1,000 | 14 | Maharashtra, UP |\n\nThe organic fraction, high in biodegradable matter and moisture, enhances the bio-methanation process.

Urban growth and high population densities are creating large landfills nearing capacity. Recycling occurs through formal and informal channels, causing environmental issues such as pollution from e-waste and improper dumping.\n\n## Government initiatives and policies to strengthen Waste to Energy Programme\n\nThe National Bioenergy Programme promotes waste-to-energy plants through the Waste to Energy (WTE) Programme, with a budget of INR 6,000 million from FY2022 to FY2026. The programme provides financial support for Biogas, Bio CNG, and power plants using urban, industrial, and agricultural waste.\n\n## The programme allows Viability Gap Funding (VGF) up to INR 2,000 million and include two sub-schemes:\n\nInfrastructure Projects: Supports water supply, solid waste management, and wastewater treatment, offering up to $30 \\%$ of the total project cost as capital grant. Additional funding can cover up to $30 \\%$ of the project cost, with projects required to recover $100 \\%$ of operational costs.\n\nDemonstration/Pilot Projects: Provides up to $40 \\%$ of the total project cost as capital grant and $25 \\%$ of the net present value of O\\&M costs for the first five years. Additional funding can cover up to $40 \\%$ of the project cost and $25 \\%$ of O\\&M costs.\n\n## Only alternative to landfilling\n\nLandfills are considered the least desirable option for waste management due to various issues, including the emission of greenhouse gases, the requirement for large areas of land, and the potential for pollutants to contaminate soil and groundwater.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 229, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# List of notable, successful, and currently operating WTE plants in India \n\nWaste-to-energy technologies transform waste materials into various forms of energy, such as electricity, heat, or fuel, through processes like combustion, gasification, or anaerobic digestion. These technologies provide a dual benefit: they process waste that would otherwise go unused, converting it into usable energy, and they significantly reduce the volume of waste sent to landfills, thereby mitigating environmental impact.\n\nFurthermore, waste-to-energy plants offer the added advantage of recovering valuable resources, such as metals and plastics, during the treatment process. These materials can be extracted, recycled, and reintroduced into the economy, supporting circular economy initiatives and reducing the need for virgin resource extraction.

To be competitive, waste-to-energy power prices need to be halved. Despite this, the primary goal of waste-to-energy plants is improving health, hygiene, and environmental conditions. Developers should receive adequate compensation through justified tariffs, and subsidies for capital expenditure could boost the sector. Operational costs can be offset by selling CBG and recyclables.\n\n## Improper assessments and unfavorable on-ground conditions\n\nMany waste-to-energy projects face challenges due to poor assessments, unrealistic projections, and on-site issues. Waste volumes fluctuate due to seasonal changes, rainfall, and transient populations. These projects should use only non-recyclable dry waste, about $25 \\%$ of total waste, which must be segregated to ensure effective energy generation.

They have already set up two CBG demo units at its refinery facility in Jannagar and commissioned the first commercial-scale CBG plant at Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh. |\n| Essar Oil | Essar Oil has shown interest in the SATAT initiative and is planning to procure CBG from potential entrepreneurs. |\n| Nayara Energy | Nayara Energy is also part of the SATAT initiative and is planning to set up CBG plants across the country. |\n\nSource: Frost \\& Sullivan research\n\n## Municipal Wet Waste to Biogas generation and selling as CNG/PNG\n\nMunicipal wet waste, such as food scraps and yard trimmings, can be converted into biogas through shredding, mixing with water, and anaerobic digestion, producing methane and carbon dioxide. This biogas can be purified to create Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Piped Natural Gas (PNG). The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy supports Waste to Energy projects for Biogas, Bio-CNG, and Power from various wastes. For example, a plant processing 20 tons of fruit and vegetable waste daily can yield about $2,400 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$ of Bio-CNG. Key factors for successful conversion include waste availability, collection costs, and digester facilities.\n\n## Leading Biogas Technology Suppliers\n\nThe Indian biogas market is dynamic, with key biogas technology suppliers shaping its trajectory.

(Source: F\\&S Report) The treatment efficiency of SBR technologies is measured by BOD and chemical oxygen demand (\"COD\") removal rates. It is a versatile technology that effectively handles seasonal, and diurnal quantity and quality variations as compared to other competing technologies by automatically sensing the water and oxygen levels. Apart from being the market leading technology adopted for treating wastewater, C-Tech has also been used to treat wastewater from refineries, pharmaceutical, petrochemical, textile, food and pesticides industries. Energy cost comprises of almost $80 \\%$ of the O\\&M cost of STP. C-Tech technology offers up to $40 \\%$ savings in power consumption as compared to other conventional technologies, thereby reducing the overall O\\&M cost of the STP. (Source: F\\&S Report) C-Tech requires up to $50 \\%$ lesser area as compared to other conventional technologies and it is easy to expand the capacity of the CTech STP to meet future needs owing to C-Tech's modular construction. C-Tech plants can be designed to generate power from primary sludge settled and removed in primary clarifiers through the use of anaerobic digesters which generates methane-rich biogas which is fed to gas engines for the generation of electricity. C-Tech's low-maintenance cost is underscored by the use of corrosion-resistant materials like stainless steel or unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (\"uPVC\") for its underwater components, significantly extending the lifespan of the plants while minimizing maintenance needs. C-Tech uses the latest automation technology, using the PLC / SCADA systems. The process automation is designed for operation without manual intervention and the performance of the STP is independent of the operators' skill. (Source: F\\&S Report) C-Tech technology introduced three path-breaking innovations, namely bacterial selection by using selectors prior to main treatment, concurrent nitrification and denitrification, and biological phosphorus removal by unique process designed based on simply switching air on and off, thereby facilitating the efficient removal of both carbon and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in a single treatment step, while also generating sludge with very low SVI, which results in excellent settling of suspended solids giving a crystal clear outlet with low suspended solids ( $<10 \\mathrm{ppm}$ ) and BOD ( $<5-10 \\mathrm{ppm}$ ). (Source: F\\&S Report)\n\nOur C-Tech system is comprised of several critical process components that collectively enhance its functionality and efficiency. Key components include the selector, dissolved oxygen (\"DO\") meter, decanter, diffusers, air blowers, submersible pumps for sludge recycle and sludge wasting (\"SW\"), and the PLC / SCADA systems for automated control. These standard components required for setting up a C-Tech project are customised and manufactured (either in-house or outsourced) as per the technical specifications of the respective projects. The design of C-Tech is unique and specifically customised for each C-Tech installation differ. The C-Tech controller automatically calculates the oxygen uptake rate (\"OUR\") and the quantity of wastewater to be treated, and accordingly adjusts the air supply and decanting rate. The operational cycle of C-Tech involves three main phases: filling \\& aeration, settling, and decanting. During the fill \\& aerate phase, wastewater is introduced into the basin where it is aerated along with the biomass for a set period. This is followed by the settling phase, where the biomass is allowed to settle under optimal conditions. The final phase of decanting involves the withdrawal of the clear supernatant of the treated wastewater, which thereafter meets all regulatory norms and is suitable for low-end recycling applications. The excess sludge generated in the process is periodically removed from the system to maintain the mixed liquor suspended solids (\"MLSS\") levels in the C-Tech basin. It is then dewatered and dried after which it can be used as a soil conditioner. This operation lasts for about 3-4 hours after which the system is ready to again take a new batch of wastewater for treatment. All the three phases described above comprise a cycle of treatment which is repeated continuously in various C-Tech basins.\n\n# C-Tech process diagram", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 254, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "![img-66.jpeg](img-66.jpeg)\n\nKey components of C-Tech\n![img-67.jpeg](img-67.jpeg)\n\nDIFFUSER\n![img-68.jpeg](img-68.jpeg)\n\nBLOWER\n\nDecanter is used to remove the clean treated wastewater supernatant from the basin. During decanting, there is no inflow to the basin. The moving weir-type decanter arm travels slowly from its \"Park\" position to a calculated bottom water level with the help of a geared drive. Variable Frequency Drive (\"VFD\") is provided to control the speed of the decanter. After the required level of treated wastewater supernatant is removed, the decanter is returned to its \"Park\" position through reversal of the geared drive. The basin is now ready for the next cycle to begin. The C-Tech decanter is specifically designed to ensure that no floating matter or floating sludge flows out with the treated wastewater. The rate of decanting is calculated to ensure no settled solids are disturbed or withdrawn with the treated wastewater.\n\nOur Company does in-house manufacturing of decanters including procurement under contract manufacturing.\n\nFine bubble polyurethane membrane diffusers are provided for efficient transfer of oxygen from air to meet the process demand.

We were the first technology provider in the SBR space with the introduction of C-Tech in India in the WWT segment. (Source: F\\&S Report) Our C-Tech technology has been implemented in the large-scale SBR-based STPs in India, including one of the largest STP under development, which has a treatment capacity of 375 MLD wastewater, as of November 2024 (Source: F\\&S Report).", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 263, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "The wastewater treatment industry has maintained a 5.5\\% CAGR over the past five years and is projected to accelerate to $9.6 \\%$ growth in the next five years. (Source: F\\&S Report)\n\n# 2. Backward integration through constant innovation and use of technology \n\nOur in-house suite of technologies, notably the C-Tech and OREX, play a key role in the growth of our business. CTech, our proprietary technology is not only superior to conventional systems but also drive significant cost, space, and environmental benefits. (Source: F\\&S Report) Our C-Tech technology, the fourth-generation SBR system, is specifically designed for high-efficiency wastewater treatment. This technology stands out for its ability to handle large volumes of sewage, achieving superior treatment efficiency with a smaller footprint compared to traditional systems. (Source: F\\&S Report) The automation of C-Tech allows for remote monitoring and control, reducing the need for extensive manpower and enabling precise management of the treatment process.\n\nOREX is our proprietary innovation, designed to efficiently separate biodegradable organics from inorganic materials and lignocellulosic fibres from mixed municipal waste. (Source: F\\&S Report) The efficiency of C-Tech manifests in multiple facets of operations. By optimizing treatment processes, C-Tech substantially reduces the operational space required as compared to other conventional technologies, which is particularly beneficial in urban settings where space is a premium commodity. Moreover, the enhanced treatment capabilities through our technologies (C-Tech and OREX) minimizes the environmental impact of waste, aligning with global sustainability standards and reducing ecological footprints. OREX automatically segregates mixed municipal waste into organic (wet) and inorganic (dry) fractions in a single step reducing the need for manual oversight, translating into lower ongoing operational costs and promotion of reuse. (Source: F\\&S Report)\n\nOur approach to backward vertical integration involves the development and manufacture of key components used in our C-Tech and OREX. By controlling the production of these critical components, we ensure quality, reduce dependency on external suppliers, and gain better control over our supply chain. This integration not only secures our operational inputs but also allows us to innovate continuously in component design and functionality, further enhancing the overall system performance.\n\nThe adoption of C-Tech and OREX technologies complimented by in-house capabilities to manufacture critical components such as decanters, diffusers, blowers and PLC / SCADA, solar sludge drying systems, underpins our derisked business model. As reflected in \"- Our Evolution\" above, we have developed and added to our in-house manufacturing capabilities over the years and integrated such in-house manufactured components into our technologies, leading to increased performance and cost efficiencies. By utilizing advanced, proprietary technologies, we mitigate risks associated with regulatory compliance, technology obsolescence, and environmental impact. Additionally, our control over the entire value chain-from technology development to component manufacturing and final waste treatment-reduces operational risks and enhances our ability to respond agilely to market changes.\n\n## 3.

Strategic Expansion of In-House Manufacturing Capabilities \n\nWith over 19 years of experience in WWT technology, we have also enhanced our product portfolio through the development of in-house manufacturing capabilities and exclusive strategic tie-ups. Towards this end, we had acquired majority of the share capital of SFC Umwelttechnik Gmbh in 2008, which was subsequently increased to $87.24 \\%$. In 2011, acquired a controlling stake in our Subsidiary, Chavare Engineering Private Limited, a company engaged in the electrical and automation solutions. Furthermore, we commenced decanter manufacturing in Fiscal 2023 and expanded our production capacity in Fiscal 2024. In 2022, we incorporated Fine Aeration Systems Private Limited in India to manufacture diffusers, a critical component of our C-Tech package and in 2024 we were authorised by EDI Inc. USA to manufacture, test and exclusively sell MP-3 MiniPanel and MP-3 Curvilinear Panel diffusers in India and overseas. Fine Aeration Systems Private Limited operates our diffusers manufacturing unit, which commenced operations in Fiscal 2023. Strengthening our manufacturing efforts, we entered into a joint venture agreement with TurboMAX Co., Ltd. to produce blowers under Turbomax India Private Limited in 2022. The turbo blowers manufacturing unit commenced operations in Fiscal 2023.\n\nOur Company has successfully built and is continuously developing in-house manufacturing capabilities for key components / products within our WWT offerings. We plan to increase the contribution of in-house manufacturing to the overall procurement requirements. This strategic move is part of our broader initiative to enhance operational efficiency and strengthen our value chain, resulting in overall better and more stable margins.\n\n## 2. Our strong technical capabilities to secure and deliver large-scale SWT projects and leverage strategic collaboration with major public-sector undertakings (\"PSU\") / oil and gas marketing companies (\"OGMCs\")\n\nOur strategy for SWT is to secure and deliver large-scale SWT projects by leveraging on:\n\n- Huge Market Opportunity: India generates over 62 million tons (MT) of waste annually with an average annual growth rate of $4 \\%$, of which 43 MT gets collected, with 12 MT ( 20\\%) being treated before disposal and the remaining 31 MT ( 50\\%) discarded in waste yards. (Source: F\\&S Report)\n- CBG Blending Obligation: In India, the compressed biogas (\"CBG\") blending obligation mandates oil marketing companies to blend CBG into their fuel infrastructure. (Source: F\\&S Report) The mandatory blending obligation will begin in FY 2025-26, starting at $1 \\%$ and gradually increasing to $5 \\%$ from FY 2028-29 onwards. (Source: F\\&S Report) This initiative mandates OGMCs to set up projects for CBG production from organic waste and biomass. (Source: F\\&S Report)\n- Our Technology experience: We have a demonstrated track record in the solid waste treatment sector, having set up and currently operating two integrated solid waste management plans in Goa, India for GWMC. For further details, see \"- Our Integrated Solid Waste Management Facilities - SWTs\" on page 273.\n- Tie up with OGMCs: Our collaborative partnerships with OGMCs are aimed to facilitate access to financial resources, assurance of offtake and scalability.\n\nTo further expand our reach and impact, we also plan to partner with city gas distribution companies (\"CGDs\"), which could potentially allow us to benefit from their existing network of gas pipelines to offtake the CBG produced at our planned waste treatment plants.\n\n## 3. Leverage national infrastructural needs and replacement demands to fuel growth.\n\nOur strategic vision is to harness national infrastructural needs, and consequent demand for waste treatment solutions (including replacement demands) as a springboard for growth. This strategy is aimed to position us not only as a leader in environmental solutions but also as a crucial partner in national development projects. Our strategic approach involves capitalizing on emerging opportunities in infrastructure development, aligning with key government initiatives, and innovating to meet the demands of urban expansion and infrastructure renewal. We are strategically positioned to capitalize on the replacement demands by offering modern waste solutions that promise higher efficiency", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 266, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "and lower environmental impact. Our strategy is to replace outdated systems with technology that can significantly enhance the operational capacities of existing waste management facilities.\n\nWe aim to secure contracts by aligning our offerings with the infrastructural objectives of major national missions such as the Amrut Mission and the National Mission for Clean Ganga. These initiatives also integrated sanitation, urban transformation, and river rejuvenation, all of which are critical components of India's broader infrastructural development plans. (Source: F\\&S Report) By contributing our advanced technological solutions and project management expertise, we aim to not only enhance our market presence but also support the government's agenda for sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\nWith rapid urbanization, many Indian cities are facing significant waste management challenges. (Source: F\\&S Report) We are poised to harness this opportunity by offering state-of-the-art waste management solutions that cater to the needs of burgeoning urban areas. Our focus extends to urban expansion projects where our innovative technologies can play a pivotal role in managing the increasing volumes of waste efficiently and sustainably. For instance, the SWT plant operated by our Subsidiary, Hindustan Waste Treatment Private Limited was operationalised in 2016 with a 100 TPD treatment capacity (with capacity to treat an additional 25 TPD). However, owing to the excess collection and increased demand to treat wastes, in 2020, we received the EPC contract from GWMC to expand this facility to 250 TPD treatment capacity (with capacity to treat an additional 50 TPD), and the expansion was completed in February 2022.\n\nExisting infrastructure across many Indian cities requires modernization to meet current environmental and operational standards. (Source: F\\&S Report) By positioning ourselves as a key player in providing waste management solutions for infrastructure projects, our Company aims to further grow its business and presence in India.\n\n# 4. International expansion in new geographies - Bangladesh, Bhutan, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Middle East and South Asia, while strengthening our presence in existing geographies \n\nOur strategy is to expand our presence in international markets including the Middle East and Africa (\"MEA\") region, and South Asia. This strategic initiative aims to broaden our global footprint, capitalize on emerging market opportunities, and enhance our international market share and profitability.\n\nTo accelerate our market penetration and improve our distribution capabilities internationally, we actively seek and evaluate potential upcoming projects, strategic tie-ups and acquisition targets. These initiatives are strategically focused on expanding our product spread and complement our existing product lines. By integrating these businesses into our global operations, we aim to leverage local market expertise, enhance our product offerings, and expand our customer base. These strategic initiatives are designed not only to extend our market presence but also to adapt our operations with additional capabilities that align with local market demands. In the past, we have delivered our WWT solutions in Kenya for a 10 MLD project, aimed at establishing our footprint in the Africa region. In addition, in 2024, we also received an order for WWT solutions for an 80 MLD project in Bangladesh. Going forward, our subsidiary, SFCU plans to expand internationally to South America and Africa regions while catering to the Europe market, and pursue opportunities to secure new projects, leveraging our expertise and comprehensive support to scale operations.\n\n## 5. Enhance business offerings through forward integration for reuse of wastewater\n\nWe are strategically planning to enhance our business offerings for treatment of wastewater, making it suitable for reuse by leveraging advanced technologies such as fibre disc filtrations, membrane-based ultrafiltration, membrane bioreaction and ozonation. Our Company currently produces its ultrafiltration membrane, C-MEM ${ }^{\\mathrm{TM}}$ at its Czech facility. In line with our commitment towards Make-in-India, our Company intends to shift the production in India. By transitioning manufacturing operations to India, our Company aims to penetrate the Indian market for tertiary wastewater treatment aiming to reduce production costs enabling competitive edge in pricing.\n\nOur Company has recently entered into an exclusive collaboration agreement with a leading ultrafiltration technology company (\"UFC\")for the distribution of its UF membranes in tertiary wastewater treatment projects in India. This exclusive tie-up is expected to strengthen our Company's market position by leveraging our extensive distribution network and technological expertise, and UFC's experience in the global water treatment sector. With this, Company is not only positioning itself to capture a larger share of the growing Indian wastewater market but also advancing into", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 267, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "forward integration enabling Company to offer a complete suite of water treatment solutions, from initial sewage treatment to advanced tertiary processes, thereby enhancing its value proposition and market reach.\n\n# OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY \n\n1.

All amounts have been roundedoff to the nearest million, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n### 2.2 Basis of accounting and preparation and presentation of financial statements\n\nThe Restated Consolidated Financial Information have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured on an alternative basis on each reporting date:\ni) Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments)\nii) Emolovee's Defined Benefit Plan as per actuarial valuation\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nIn addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorized into Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:\nLevel 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;\nLevel 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nWhen measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the group uses observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.\n\n### 2.3 Use of estimates and Judgements\n\nThe preparation of these restated consolidated financials information in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires the management of the Group to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of the restated consoldiated financial information and the reported amounts of income and expense for the periods presented.\n\nThe estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates considering different assumptions and conditions. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Impact on account of revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected. The following are the critical estimates, assumptions and judgements that the management have made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that have a significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements:\n(a) Useful lives of Property, plant and equipment:\n\nProperty, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset's expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Group's assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically.\n(b) Employee benefits:\n\nEmployee benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, employee benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n(c) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets\n\nThe Group uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 349, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# SFC Environmental Technologies Limited \n\n(Formerly known as SFC Environmental Technologies Private Limited)\n\n## Annexure V\n\nNotes to Restated Consolidated Financial Information\nCIN: U37003MH200SPLC1S223S\n(Currency: Indian Rupees in Millions, unless otherwise stated)\n(d) Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. The Group uses significant judgements to disclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the financial statements.\n(e) Fair value measurement of financial instruments\n\nWhen the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.\n(f) Allowance for credit losses on receivables\n\nThe Group determines the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Group considered current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the countries where it operates.\n(g) Impairment of non- financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre- tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset. In determining fair value less cost of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share price for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators.\n\n### 2.4 Classification of Assets and Liabilities into Current/Non-Current\n\nThe Operating Cycle of the Group is the time between the acquisitions of the assets for processing and their realisation in cash \\& cash equivalents. The Group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle for the purpose of current and non current classification of assets and liabilities.\nFor the purpose of Balance Sheet, an asset is classified as current if:\n(i) It is expected to be realized, or is intended to be sold or consumed, in the normal operating cycle; or\n(ii) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or\n(iii) It is expected to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n(iv) The asset is a cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\nAll other assets are classified as non-current.\nSimilarly, a liability is classified as current if:\n(i) It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; or\n(ii) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or\n(iii) It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n(iv) The Group does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that could result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments at the option of the counterparty does not affect this classification.\nAll other liabilities are classified as non-current.\n\n## 3 Material accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to the periods presented in the Financials Statements.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 350, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# SFC Environmental Technologies Limited \n\n(Formerly known as SFC Environmental Technologies Private Limited)\n\n## Annexure V\n\nNotes to Restated Consolidated Financial Information\nCIN: U37003MH2005PLC152235\n(Currency: Indian Rupees in Millions, unless otherwise stated)\n\n### 3.1 Basis of Consolidation\n\ni) Consolidation of subsidiaries\n\nConsolidation of a subsidiary begins when the parent company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit and loss from the date the Group gains control until the date when the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:\nhas power over the investee;\nis exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\nhas the ability to use its power to affect its returns.\nThe Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.\nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group's accounting policies.\nii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nIntra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\nThe consolidated financial statements present the consolidated accounts which consist of accounts of the Company and that of the following subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures of the Group.\niii) Equity - accounted investee (Associate)\n\nThe interest in equity in investees comprise interests in associates. An associate is an entity in which the group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Interests in associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost which includes transaction costs.

The transaction price of goods sold and services rendered is net of variable consideration. Revenue excludes taxes collected from customers on behalf of the government. Any amount receivable from customer are recognized as revenue at the point in time when control of the goods sold are transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods.\n\nRevenue from service concession arrangement has been accounted under the financial asset model. The entity recognizes financial asset arising from service concession arrangement to the extent it has an unconditional contractual right to receive payment. Financial assets are initially recognized at their fair value. Contract cost is recognized as the total cost incurred towards the financial assets. Contract revenue represents revenue from contracts wherein the performance obligation is satisfied over a period of time. and revenue is recognized by additionally applying specified margin on the total cost incurred towards the financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition financial assets are recognized at amortized cost.\n\nCosts to obtain a contract which are incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained are charged off in Statement of Profit and Loss immediately in the period in which such costs are incurred.\nThe scrap sales arising directly due to operating activity is a part of revenue from operations.\n\n### 3.3 Recognition of Dividend Income, Interest income or expense\n\nInterest income or expense is recognized using the effective interest method.\nThe 'effective interest rate' is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of\n\n- the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or\n- the amortized cost of the financial liability\n\nIn calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortized cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\n\n## Other income\n\nInterest income from other financial assets is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably.\nInterest income is recognized on time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the interest rate applicable.\n\n### 3.4 Property, Plant \\& Equipment (PPE)\n\nPPE is recognised when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes professional fees related to the acquisition of PPE and for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group's accounting policy.\nExpenditure incurred after the PPE have been put into use such as repairs and maintenance, are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the costs are incurred.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the assets's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Advances given towards acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at each reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under \"Other non-current Assets\"\n\n## Depreciation:\n\nDepreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is provided using written down value method, so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, or in the case of assets where the useful life was determined by technical evaluation, over the useful life so determined. Depreciation method is reviewed at each financial year end to reflect the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. The estimated useful life and residual values are also reviewed at each financial year end and the effect of any change in the estimates of useful life/residual value is accounted on prospective basis. In respect of additions to /deletions from the PPE, depreciation is provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the month of addition/deletion of the Assets.\nGains or losses arising from de-recognition of a Property, Plant and Equipment are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n### 3.5 Investment Property\n\nInvestment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Upon initial recognition, an investment property is measured at cost. After initial recognition, the company measures investment property by using cost model. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.\nThe company depreciates the investment properties on written down value which is in line with the indicative useful life of relevant type of building mentioned in Part C of Schedule II to the Act.\nThough investment property is measured using cost model, the fair value of investment property is disclosed in the notes.\n\n### 3.6 Leases\n\nThe Group, as a lessee, recognises a right-of use asset and a lease liability for its leasing arrangements, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset.\nThe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, if it involves the use of an identified asset and the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset and has right to direct the use of the identified asset. The cost of the right of use asset shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date plus any initial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use assets is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation/amortisation,\naccumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated/amortised using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\nThe Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate.\nFor short-term and low value leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Group, as a lessor, classifies a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease. Leases are classified as finance lease whenever the terms\nof the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating Irasps.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 359, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# SFC Environmental Technologies Limited \n\n(Formerly known as SFC Environmental Technologies Private Limited)\n\n## Annexure V\n\nNotes to Restated Consolidated Financial Information\nCIN: U37003MH2005PLC152235\n(Currency: Indian Rupees in Millions, unless otherwise stated)\n\n### 3.7 Financial Instruments\n\n## i) Recognition and initial measurement\n\nThe Group recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition.\n\n## ii) Classification and subsequent measurement Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)\n\nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss. This includes all derivative financial assets (see Note 55).\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognised in the standalone statement of profit and\n\n## iii) Derecognition <br> Financial Assets\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows to one or Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Group evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognised. Where the entity has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognised. Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the Group has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Group retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset.\n\n## Financial Liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying value of the financial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in standalone statement of profit and loss.\n\n### 3.8 Impairment of assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine whether there is any impairment. Impairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent, the carrying amount of assets exceeds their recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Impairment loss is recognized in the statement of profit and loss or against revaluation surplus, where applicable. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject to maximum of depreciated historical cost.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 360, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# SFC Environmental Technologies Limited \n\n(Formerly known as SFC Environmental Technologies Private Limited)\n\n## Annexure V\n\nNotes to Restated Consolidated Financial Information\nCIN: U37003MH2005PLC152235\n(Currency: Indian Rupees in Millions, unless otherwise stated)\n\n## i) Non-derivative financial assets\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group uses 'Expected Credit Loss' (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of all financial assets subsequent to initial recognition other than financial assets measured at fair valued through profit and loss (FVTPL). For Trade Receivables the Group applies 'simplified approach' which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. The Group uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on the portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed. For other financial assets, the Group uses 12 month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in credit risk since its initial recognition. If there is significant increase in credit risk since its initial recognition full lifetime ECL is used.\nThe impairment losses and reversals are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## ii) Impairment of non-financial Asset\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than inventories, contract assets and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of an asset or Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belong. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an individual asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.\nImpairment losses are recognized in profit or loss to the extent, asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\n### 3.9 Inventories\n\nInventories are valued after providing for obsolescence, as under:\na) Raw materials, components, stores and spares at lower of cost or net realisable value. However, these items are considered to be realisable at cost if the finished products in which they will be used, are expected to be sold at or above cost.\nb) Work-in-progress and Finished goods are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost includes cost of raw materials, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\nCost is determined on weighted average basis which includes expenditure incurred for acquiring inventories like purchase price, import duties, taxes (net of tax credit) and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Assessment of net realisable value is made in each subsequent period and when the circumstances that previously caused inventories to be written-down below cost no longer exist or when there is clear evidence of an increase in net realisable value because of changed economic circumstances, the write-down, if any, in the past period is reversed to the extent of the original amount written-down so that the resultant carrying amount is the lower of the cost and the revised net realisable value.\n\n### 3.10 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as a finance cost.\nContingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\nA contingent asset is not recognised unless it becomes virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise. When an inflow of economic benefits is probable, contingent asset are disclosed in the financial statements.\nProvisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 361, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# SFC Environmental Technologies Limited \n\n(Formerly known as SFC Environmental Technologies Private Limited)\n\n## Annexure V\n\nNotes to Restated Consolidated Financial Information\nCIN: U37003MH2005PLC152235\n(Currency: Indian Rupees in Millions, unless otherwise stated)\n\n### 3.11 Employee benefits\n\nEmployee benefits include provident fund and gratuity fund.\n(i) Defined Contribution Plan:\n\nThe Group's contributions towards provident fund is defined contribution scheme.

The Group's net obligation in respect of the gratuity benefit scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.\nThe present value of the obligation under such defined benefit plans is determined based on actuarial valuation at each balance sheet date by an independent actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method, which recognizes each period of service as giving rise to additional unit of employee benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.\nThe obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plans are based on the market yields on Government securities as at the balance sheet date. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the net total of any unrecognized actuarial losses and past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\nActuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the statement of other comprehensive income.\n\n### 3.12 Taxation\n\nThe tax expenses comprise of current tax and deferred income tax charge or credit. Tax is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income or in Equity. In which case, the tax is also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Equity, respectively.\n\n## Current Tax\n\nCurrent tax is determined as the amount of tax payable in respect of taxable income for the period. Taxable profit differs from 'profit before tax' as reported in the statement of profit and loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.\nThe amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\n## Deferred Tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the group's financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit and quantified using the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted as on the Balance Sheet date.\nDeferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

Deferred tax assets relating to unabsorbed depreciation/business losses are recognised and carried forward to the extent of available taxable temporary differences or where there is convincing other evidence that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the group expects, at the end of reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Transaction or event which is recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or in equity, is recorded along with the tax as applicable. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.\n\n\n### 3.13 Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the Group's functional currency are recorded on initial recognition using the exchange rate at the transaction date or at rates that closely approximate the rate at the date of the transaction. At each Balance Sheet date, foreign currency monetary items are reported using the closing rate. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transactions. Exchange differences that arise on settlement of monetary items or on reporting of monetary items at each Balance Sheet date are recognised in the Statement of Profit \\& Loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n### 3.14 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash, cheque in hand, cash at banks and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n### 3.15 Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. For this purpose, the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities representing present obligation and they are measured at their acquisition date fair values irrespective of the fact that outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:\n\n1. Deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with Ind AS 12 Income Taxes and Ind AS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;\n2. Liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or sharebased payment arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with Ind AS 102 Share-based Payments at the acquisition date; and\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisitiondate amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\n\nIn case of bargain purchase, before recognising gain in respect thereof, the Group determines whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase. Thereafter, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that reassessment. The Group then reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts that Ind AS requires for the purposes of calculating the bargain purchase. If the gain remains after this reassessment and review, the Group recognises it in other comprehensive income and accumulates the same in equity as capital reserve. This gain is attributed to the acquirer. If there does not exist clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase, the Group", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 363, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# SFC Environmental Technologies Limited \n\n(Formerly known as SFC Environmental Technologies Private Limited)\n\n## Annexure V\n\nNotes to Restated Consolidated Financial Information\nCIN: U37003MH2005PLC152235\n(Currency: Indian Rupees in Millions, unless otherwise stated)\nrecognises the gain, after reassessing and reviewing, directly in equity as capital reserve.\nNon-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity's net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the\nnon-controlling interests' proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Other types of noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in another Ind AS. When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date when the Group obtains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the financial year, the provisional amounts for which the accounting is incomplete shall be disclosed in the financial statements and provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date shall be retrospectively adjusted during the measurement period. During the measurement period, the group shall also recognise additional assets or liabilities if the new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date. However, the measurement period shall not exceed the period of one year from the acquisition date. Business combinations involving entities or businesses under common control shall be accounted for using the pooling of interest method.\n\n### 3.16 Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year and equity shares to be issued on conversion of mandatorily convertible instruments. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period and for all periods presented is adjusted for events such as bonus issue; bonus element in a rights issue to existing shareholders; share split; and reverse share split (consolidation of shares) that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.\n\n### 3.17 Cash flow statement\n\nCash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby the net profit/ (loss) before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments. The cash flows from regular revenue generating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated.\nCash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement comprise cash, cheque in hand, cash at banks and bank deposits with original maturity of three months or less.\n\n### 3.18 Events after reporting date\n\nWhere events occurring after the balance sheet date provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, the impact of such events is adjusted with financial statements. Otherwise, events after the balance sheet date of material size or nature are only disclosed.\n\n## 4 Recent pronouncement\n\nThere are no standards of accounting or any addendum thereto, prescribed by Ministry of Corporate Affairs under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, which are issued and not effective as at June 30, 2024.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 364, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# SFC Environmental Technologies Limited \n\n(Formerly known as SFC Environmental Technologies Private Limited)\n\n## Annexure VI\n\nNotes to Restated Consolidated Financial Information\nCIN: U37003MH2005PLC152235\n(Currency: Indian Rupees in Millions, unless otherwise stated)\n\n## Statement of adjustments to restated consolidated financial information\n\nPart A: Statement of adjustments to restated consolidated financial information\n\n## Reconciliation between audited equity and restated equity\n\n| Particulars | Quarter ended June 30, 2024 | Quarter ended June 30, 2023 | Year ended March 31, 2024 | Year ended March 31, 2023 | Year ended March 31, 2022 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Total equity (as per audited Financial statements) | 5,548.24 | 4,100.60 | 5,611.45 | 4,064.14 | 3,388.17 |\n| Adjustments |  |  |  |  |  |\n| (i) Audit qualifications | - | - | - | - | - |\n| (ii) Adjustments due to change in accounting policy / prior period items / other adjustments | - | - | - | - | - |\n| (iii) Deferred tax impact on adjustments in (i) and (ii), as applicable | - | - | - | - | - |\n| Total adjustments (i + ii + iii) | - | - | - | - | - |\n| Total Equity as per restated consolidated summary statement of assets and liabilities | 5,548.24 | 4,100.60 | 5,611.45 | 4,064.14 | 3,388.17 |\n\n## Reconciliation between audited profit and restated profit\n\n| Particulars | Quarter ended June 30, 2024 | Quarter ended June 30, 2023 | Year ended March 31, 2024 | Year ended March 31, 2023 | Year ended March 31, 2022 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Profit/(Loss) after Tax (as per audited Financial statements) | 65.01 | 26.80 | 1,441.73 | 948.09 | 851.60 |\n| Adjustments |  |  |  |  |  |\n| (i) Audit qualifications | - | - | - | - | - |\n| (ii) Adjustments due to change in accounting policy / prior period items / other adjustments | - | - | - | - | - |\n| (iii) Deferred tax impact on adjustments in (i) and (ii), as applicable | - | - | - | - | - |\n| Total adjustments (i + ii + iii) | - | - | - | - | - |\n| Restated Profit/(Loss) after Tax | 65.01 | 26.80 | 1,441.73 | 948.09 | 851.60 |\n\n## Material regrouping: None\n\nThere have been no re-groupings required to be made in the Restated Consolidated Balance Sheet, Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and Restated Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, wherever required, by reclassification of the corresponding items of income, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows, in order to bring them in line with the accounting policies and classification as per the Ind AS financial information of the Group respectively prepared in accordance with amended Schedule III of Companies Act, 2013, requirements of Ind AS 1 and other applicable Ind AS principles and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital \\& Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018, as amended.\n\n## Part B: Non-Adjusting events\n\nQualifications in Auditors' Report, which do not require any corrective adjustments in the Restated consolidated Financial Information\nThere are no audit qualification in auditor's report or in the report of internal financial control for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 and financial year ended 31 March 2024, 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, which require corrective actions.\n\nIn addition to the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements, the auditors are required to comment upon the other legal \\& regulatory matters under section 143 of Companies Act, 2013 on the financial statements as at and for the financial years ended 31 March 2024, 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 respectively.

The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group's operations. The Group's principal financial assets include investments, loans, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances and other financial assets that derive directly from its operations. The Group is exposed preliminary to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets \\& seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance.\n(A) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: Foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk. The Group's exposure to market risk is on account of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.\n(i) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group's borrowings with floating interest rates. The fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost, hence, they are not subject to interest rate risk since the carrying amount and future cash flows will not fluctuate because of change in market interest rates. The exposure of the Group's borrowings to interest rate changes at the end of reporting period are as follows:\n\n| Particulars | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2023 | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2022 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Variable rate borrowings | 865.32 | 841.43 | 1,302.78 | 460.18 | 373.26 |\n| Fixed rate borrowings | 3.90 | 3.90 | 3.90 | 3.90 | 6.54 |\n| Total | 869.22 | 845.33 | 1,306.68 | 464.08 | 379.79 |\n\n## Interest rate sensitivity\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and borrowings. With all other variables held constant, the Group's profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:\n\n| Particulars | Increase/ decrease in basis points | Effect on profit after tax | Effect on Equity |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| For period ended June 30, 2024 |  |  |  |\n| INR | $+100$ | 0.19 | 0.19 |\n| INR | $-100$ | $(0.19)$ | $(0.19)$ |\n| For period ended June 30, 2023 |  |  |  |\n| INR | $+100$ | 0.05 | 0.05 |\n| INR | $-100$ | $(0.05)$ | $(0.05)$ |", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 425, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# SFC Environmental Technologies Limited \n\n(Formerly known as SFC Environmental Technologies Private Limited)\n\n## Annexure VII\n\nNotes to Restated Consolidated Financial Information\nCIN: U37003MH2005PLC152235\n(Currency: Indian Rupees in Millions, unless otherwise stated)\n\n| For period ended March 31, 2024 |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| INR |  | $+100$ | 0.48 | 0.48 |\n| INR |  | $-100$ | $(0.48)$ | $(0.48)$ |\n| For Year period March 31, 2023 |  |  |  |  |\n| INR |  | $+100$ | 0.14 | 0.14 |\n| INR |  | $-100$ | $(0.14)$ | $(0.14)$ |\n| For Year period March 31, 2022 |  |  |  |  |\n| INR |  | $+100$ | 0.13 | 0.13 |\n| INR |  | $-100$ | $(0.13)$ | $(0.13)$ |\n\n(ii) Foreign currency risk\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.

Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and credit worthiness of the customer on continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. The financial instruments that are subject to concentration of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables and cash and bank equivalents.\n\nTo manage credit risk, the Group follows a policy of providing credit to its customers based on prevailing market credit terms. The credit limit policy is established considering the current economic trend of the industry in which the Group is operating. Also, the trade receivables are monitored on a periodic basis for assessing any significant risk of non-recoverability of dues and provision is created accordingly. These receivables are monitored on a periodic basis for assessing any significant risk of non-recoverability of dues and provision is created accordingly.\n\nThe Group recognises lifetime expected credit losses on trade receivable using simplified approach by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and rates used in provision matrix.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 428, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# SFC Environmental Technologies Limited \n\n(Formerly known as SFC Environmental Technologies Private Limited)\nAnnexure VII\nNotes to Restated Consolidated Financial Information\nCIN: U37003MH2005PLC152235\n(Currency: Indian Rupees in Millions, unless otherwise stated)\n\n| Particulars | Quarter ended June 30, 2024 | Quarter ended June 30, 2023 | Year ended March 31, 2024 | Year ended March 31, 2023 | Year ended March 31, 2022 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Impairment losses on financial assets recognised profit \\& loss were as follows: Impairment loss/(gain) on trade receivables arising from contracts with customer | $(0.04)$ | 0.34 | 1.00 | 4.24 | $(28.87)$ |\n\nThe following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECL's for trade receivables Trade Receivable as at June 30, 2024\n\n| Ageing | Average loss rate | Gross Carrying Amount | Allowance for expected credit loss | Net Carrying Amount |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Unbilled | -

Actual results may differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of factors such as those set forth under \"Forward Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" on pages 27 and 44, respectively.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nFor an overview of our business, please see \"Our Business - Overview\" on page 253.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Ability to effectively execute and expand our order book\n\nOur order book and the new projects that we have bid for and will continue to bid for in the future will have an effect on the revenues we will earn in the future. As at September 30, 2024, we had an order book of \u20b96,314.93 million of WWT segment, which amounted to $120.21 \\%$ of our revenue from operations from WWT segment for Fiscal 2024, and $95.91 \\%$ our total revenue from operations for Fiscal 2024. As of March 31, 2024, March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, we had an order book in the WWT segment of \u20b96,564.47 million, \u20b95,574.20 million and \u20b95,280.90 million, respectively.\n\nOur order book, the likelihood of the completion of contracts reflected in our order book and the period over which such contracts are likely to be executed, may vary significantly based on the product or service, and various factors that may affect our operations or the time period within which we are able to execute such contracts. Even where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that contracting parties may default or delay and fail to pay amounts owed.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 446, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "Any delay, cancellation or payment default could adversely affect our cash flow position, revenues and/or profit. Many of these factors may be beyond our control.\n\nAccordingly, the realization of our order book and the effect on our results of operations may vary significantly depending on the nature of such contracts, actual performance of such contracts, as well as the stage of completion of such contracts as of the relevant reporting date as it is impacted by applicable accounting principles affecting revenue and cost recognition. The value of the orders we receive and our ability to execute them in a timely manner therefore impacts our future performance. As we expand our order book, the modified terms of payments for new projects may necessitate higher working capital requirements and therefore impact our financial performance. Any cancellation of orders or termination of projects under construction by our customers may result in a reduction of our future revenue. Any delay in payments that are due and payable to us will affect our operations and have an impact on our cash flows. This may result in an increase in our working capital borrowings thereby affecting our business and results of operations\n\n# Maintaining our customer relationships \n\nWe believe that our continued relationship with our customers plays a significant role in determining our continued success and results of operations. Our relationship with these customers have thus been gradually strengthened by proving our reliability and quality over a period of time. The demand for our services and products from our customers has a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Over the years, we have successfully executed a diverse portfolio of projects spanning various capacities and geographical locations. Set out below are details of our revenue attributable to repeat customers for the periods mentioned:\n\n| Financial Year / Period | Revenue from repeat customers <br> (in \u20b9 million) | Revenue from repeat customers as a \\% <br> of revenue from operations |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| Three months ended June 30, 2024 | 383.50 | $75.48 \\%$ |\n| FY 2024 | $4,691.84$ | $89.96 \\%$ |\n| FY 2023 | $3,421.83$ | $83.18 \\%$ |\n| FY 2022 | $2,417.20$ | $62.21 \\%$ |\n\nNote: Revenues from repeat customers refer to the revenue generated from customers from whom our Company has derived revenues in any of the three preceding fiscal years for the respective financial year (on standalone basis).\n\nIn the event that we lose any of our major customers or if the amount of business we receive from them is reduced for any reason, our cash flows and results of operations may be affected. Our arrangements with our customers also require us to meet certain standards and performance obligations and our failure to meet such specifications could result in a reduction of business from them, termination of contracts or additional costs and penalties, all of which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Technology and process innovation\n\nOver the years, we have developed a suite of proprietary technologies and engineering solutions. Our technology prowess and proficiency help us improve our service delivery and maintain and improve our margins and profit ability. Our ability to stay abreast of such changes and provide commercially viable and marketable solutions to our customers plays a significant role in determining the attractiveness of our offering to customers. Our future success will depend substantially on our ability to respond to new technologies.\n\n## Management of our costs, including those of our raw materials cost management through backward and forward integration\n\nOur ability to profitably expand our execution capabilities is dependent on our ability to efficiently manage our corresponding increase in expenditures and achieve timely completion and commissioning of our projects. We believe that our backward integration strategy will further enhance our operations and increase profitability by development and manufacture of key components, to achieve cost savings and improve profit margins. By increasing our backward integration measures, we will be in a position to control the quality and availability of materials which in turn will reduce reliance on external suppliers and enhance our ability to negotiate more favorable pricing from customers.\n\nWe depend on external suppliers for our materials and components required and typically purchase materials and", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 447, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "components on a purchase order basis and place such orders with them in advance on the basis of our anticipated requirements. As a result, the success of our business is significantly dependent on maintaining good relationships with our materials and component suppliers. Further, we source raw materials from a number of international suppliers as well as from vendors in India. Our supply arrangements are subject to price volatility caused by various factors such as market fluctuation, currency fluctuations, climatic and environmental conditions, production and transportation cost, changes in domestic as well as international government policies, and regulatory and trade sanctions. Changes in import duties also impact our cost materials consumed and consequently operating margins. If we cannot fully offset increases in material prices with increases in the prices for our services and products, we will experience lower margins.\n\n# Our execution capabilities \n\nOur projects for SWT segment are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process. This process therefore involves pre-qualifying for bids based on the company's technical and financial strengths, and an evaluation of the nature and value of contracts executed in the past to determine a company's eligibility to bid for new projects. Further, the ability to strategically partner with other players also determines the outcome of pre-qualification and consequently the award of projects.\n\nWhile evaluating our performance in contracts previously executed, our project management capabilities are also assessed. This would require continuing and improving on our project management practices which includes amongst others efficient equipment and material sourcing, good communication between the site office and head office, and project planning and monitoring to suit the projects under execution. Our ability to continue implementation of such practices as our business grows would determine our overall performance, which is likely to impact our profitability.\n\n## Availability of cost-effective funding sources\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our outstanding borrowings (on a consolidated basis) aggregated to $\u20b9 1,741.23$ million. Any increase in interest expense may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In cases, significant amounts of working capital are required to finance the performance of engineering, construction and other work on projects before payments are received from clients. Our finance costs are dependent on various external factors, including Indian and global credit markets and, in particular, interest rate movements and adequate liquidity. We believe that we have been able to maintain relatively stable finance costs. Our ability to maintain our finance costs at optimum levels will continue to have a direct impact on our profitability, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## - Basis for Measurement:\n\nThe Restated Consolidated Financial Information have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Indian Accounting Standards (\"Ind AS\") notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 issued by Ministry of Corporate Affairs in respect of Section 133 read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.

These financial statements cannot be referred to or distributed or included in any offering document or used for any other purpose except as stated above.\n\n- Further, there were no changes in accounting policies during the period of these Financial Statements (Refer Annexure VI - \"Statement of adjustments to restated consolidated financial information\");", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 449, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "- There were no material amounts which have been adjusted for, in arriving at profit / loss of the respective periods.\n\nThe Restated Consolidated Financial Information have been prepared so as to contain information / disclosures and incorporating adjustments set out below in accordance with the SEBI ICDR Regulations:\na. Adjustments for reclassification of the corresponding items of income, expenses, assets and liabilities, in order to bring them in line with the groupings as per the Restated Financial Information of the Group for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and the requirements of the SEBI ICDR Regulations, if any;\nb. do not require any adjustments for modifications as there is no modification in the underlying audit reports.\n\nThe Restated Consolidated Financial Information for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 and year ended March 31, 2024, March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 were approved for issue in accordance with the resolution of the Board of Directors on November 28, 2024.\n\nThese Restated Consolidated Financial Information are presented in Indian Rupees (INR), which is also the functional currency. All amounts have been rounded-off to the nearest million, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n# - Basis of accounting and preparation and presentation of Restated Consolidated Financial Information \n\nThe Restated Consolidated Financial Information have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured on an alternative basis on each reporting date:\na) Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments)\nb) Employee's Defined Benefit Plan as per actuarial valuation.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\n\nIn addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorized into Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:\n\nLevel 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;\nLevel 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nWhen measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the group uses observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.\n\n## - Use of estimates and Judgements\n\nThe preparation of these Restated Consolidated Financial Information in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires the management of the group to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of the Restated Consolidated Financial Information and the reported amounts of income and expense for the periods presented.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 450, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates considering different assumptions and conditions. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Impact on account of revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised, and future periods are affected. The following are the critical estimates, assumptions and judgements that the management have made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that have a significant effect on the amounts recognized in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information:\n(a) Useful lives of Property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset's expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Group's assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically.\n(b) Employee benefits: Employee benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, employee benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n(c) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets: The Group uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.\n(d) Provisions and contingent liabilities: The Group estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events, and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. The Group uses significant judgements to disclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information.\n(e) Fair value measurement of financial instruments: When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.\n(f) Allowance for credit losses on receivables: The Group determines the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Group considered current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the countries where it operates.\n(g) Impairment of non- financial assets: The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre- tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset. In determining fair value less cost of disposal, recent market", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 451, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share price for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators.\n\n# - Classification of Assets and Liabilities into Current/Non-Current: \n\nThe Operating Cycle of the Group is the time between the acquisitions of the assets for processing and their realisation in cash \\& cash equivalents. The Group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle for the purpose of current and non current classification of assets and liabilities.\n\nFor the purpose of Balance Sheet, an asset is classified as current if:\n(a) It is expected to be realized, or is intended to be sold or consumed, in the normal operating cycle; or\n(b) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or\n(c) It is expected to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n(d) The asset is a cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other assets are classified as non-current.\nSimilarly, a liability is classified as current if:\n(a) It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; or\n(b) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or\n(c) It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n(d) The Group does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that could result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments at the option of the counterparty does not affect this classification.\n\nAll other liabilities are classified as non-current.\n\n## - Basis of Consolidation\n\n(a) Consolidation of Subsidiaries: Consolidation of a Subsidiary begins when the parent company obtains control over the Subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the Subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a Subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit and loss from the date the group gains control until the date when the group ceases to control the Subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its Subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:\ni. has power over the investee;\nii. is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\niii. has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.\n\nThe Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.\n\nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group's accounting policies.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 452, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "(b) Transactions eliminated on consolidation: Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. The consolidated financial statements present the consolidated accounts which consist of accounts of the Company and that of the following subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures of the Group.\n(c) Equity - accounted investee (Associate): The interest in equity in investees comprise interests in associates. An associate is an entity in which the group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Interests in associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition the Restated Consolidated Financial Information include the groups share of profit or loss and OCI of equity accounted investee until the date on which significant influence ceases.\n\n# - Revenue from contracts with customers \n\na) Revenue from operations: Revenue is recognized on the basis of approved contracts regarding the transfer of goods or services to a customer for an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price of goods sold and services rendered is net of variable consideration. Revenue excludes taxes collected from customers on behalf of the government. Any amount receivable from customer are recognized as revenue at the point in time when control of the goods sold are transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods.\nb) Revenue from service concession arrangement has been accounted under the financial asset model. The entity recognizes financial asset arising from service concession arrangement to the extent it has an unconditional contractual right to receive payment. Financial assets are initially recognized at their fair value. Contract cost is recognized as the total cost incurred towards the financial assets. Contract revenue represents revenue from contracts wherein the performance obligation is satisfied over a period of time. and revenue is recognized by additionally applying specified margin on the total cost incurred towards the financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition financial assets are recognized at amortized cost.\nc) Costs to obtain a contract which are incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained are charged off in Statement of Profit and Loss immediately in the period in which such costs are incurred.\nd) The scrap sales arising directly due to operating activity is a part of revenue from operations.\n\n## - Recognition of Dividend Income, Interest income or expense\n\nInterest income or expense is recognized using the effective interest method. The 'effective interest rate' is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:\na) the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or\nb) the amortized cost of the financial liability\n\nIn calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortized cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 453, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\nOther Income: Interest income from other financial assets is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is recognized on time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the interest rate applicable.\n\n# - Property, Plant \\& Equipment (PPE) \n\nPPE is recognised when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes professional fees related to the acquisition of PPE and for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group's accounting policy.\n\nExpenditure incurred after the PPE have been put into use such as repairs and maintenance, are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the costs are incurred.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the assets's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance cost are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the period in which they were incurred.\n\nIf significant parts of an item of PPE have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of PPE.\n\n## Capital work in Progress:\n\nExpenditure during construction period (including financing cost related to borrowed funds for construction or acquisition of qualifying PPE if any) is included under Capital Work-in-Progress, and the same is allocated to the respective PPE on the completion of their construction. Advances given towards acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at each reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under \"Other non-current Assets\"\n\n## Depreciation:\n\nDepreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is provided using written down value method, so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, or in the case of assets where the useful life was determined by technical evaluation, over the useful life so determined. Depreciation method is reviewed at each financial year end to reflect the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. The estimated useful life and residual values are also reviewed at each financial year end and the effect of any change in the estimates of useful life/residual value is accounted on prospective basis. In respect of additions to /deletions from the PPE, depreciation is provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the month of addition/deletion of the Assets.\n\nGains or losses arising from de-recognition of a Property, Plant and Equipment are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## - Investment Property\n\nInvestment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Upon initial recognition, an investment property is measured at cost. After initial recognition, the company measures investment property by using cost model. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 454, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "The company depreciates the investment properties on written down value which is in line with the indicative useful life of relevant type of building mentioned in Part C of Schedule II to the Act.\n\nThough investment property is measured using cost model, the fair value of investment property is disclosed in the notes.\n\n# - Leases \n\nThe Group, as a lessee, recognises a right-of use asset and a lease liability for its leasing arrangements, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset.\n\nThe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, if it involves the use of an identified asset and the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset and has right to direct the use of the identified asset. The cost of the right of use asset shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date plus any initial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use assets is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation/amortisation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated/amortised using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\n\nThe Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate.\n\nFor short-term and low value leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Group, as a lessor, classifies a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease. Leases are classified as finance lease whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\n\n## - Financial Instruments\n\na) Recognition and initial measurement: The Group recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition.\nb) Classification and subsequent measurement\ni. Financial assets at amortised cost: Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nii. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 455, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "iii. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss. This includes all derivative financial assets.\niv. Financial liabilities: Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\nc) Derecognition:\ni. Financial Assets: The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows to one or more recipient. Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Group evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognised. Where the entity has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognised. Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the Group has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Group retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset.\nii. Financial Liabilities: A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying value of the financial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in statement of profit and loss.\n\n# - Impairment of assets \n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine whether there is any impairment. Impairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent, the carrying amount of assets exceeds their recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Impairment loss is recognized in the statement of profit and loss or against revaluation surplus, where applicable. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject to maximum of depreciated historical cost.\na) Non-derivative financial assets: In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group uses 'Expected Credit Loss' (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of all financial assets subsequent to initial recognition other than financial assets measured at fair valued through profit and loss (FVTPL). For Trade Receivables the Group applies 'simplified approach' which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. The Group uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on the portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed. For other financial assets, the Group uses 12 month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in credit risk since its initial recognition. If there is significant increase in credit risk since its initial recognition full lifetime ECL is used. The impairment losses and reversals are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.\nb) Impairment of non-financial Asset: At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than inventories, contract assets and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of an asset or Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any.

A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an individual asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.\nImpairment losses are recognized in profit or loss to the extent, asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\n# - Inventories \n\nInventories are valued after providing for obsolescence, as under:\na) Raw materials, components, stores and spares at lower of cost or net realisable value. However, these items are considered to be realisable at cost if the finished products in which they will be used, are expected to be sold at or above cost.\nb) Work-in-progress and Finished goods are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost includes cost of raw materials, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n\nCost is determined on weighted average basis which includes expenditure incurred for acquiring inventories like purchase price, import duties, taxes (net of tax credit) and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Assessment of net realisable value is made in each subsequent period and when the circumstances that previously caused inventories to be written-down below cost no longer exist or when there is clear evidence of an increase in net realisable value because of changed economic circumstances, the write-down, if any, in the past period is reversed to the extent of the original amount writtendown so that the resultant carrying amount is the lower of the cost and the revised net realisable value.\n\n## Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as a finance cost.\n\nContingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\nA contingent asset is not recognised unless it becomes virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise. When an inflow of economic benefits is probable, contingent asset are disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nProvisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 457, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# - Employee benefits \n\nEmployee benefits include provident fund and gratuity fund.\na) Defined Contribution Plan: The Group's contributions towards provident fund is defined contribution scheme. The Group's contribution paid/payable under the schemes is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on accrual basis during the period in which the employee renders the related service.\nb) Short-Term Employee Benefits: All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages, and short term compensated absences, etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia, if any are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which the employee renders the related service.\nc) Defined benefit plan: The Group's gratuity benefit scheme with Life Insurance Corporation of India is a defined benefit plan. The Group's net obligation in respect of the gratuity benefit scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The present value of the obligation under such defined benefit plans is determined based on actuarial valuation at each balance sheet date by an independent actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method, which recognizes each period of service as giving rise to additional unit of employee benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation. The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plans are based on the market yields on Government securities as at the balance sheet date. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the net total of any unrecognized actuarial losses and past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the statement of other comprehensive income.\n\n## - Taxation\n\nThe tax expenses comprise of current tax and deferred income tax charge or credit. Tax is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income or in Equity. In which case, the tax is also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Equity, respectively.\n\n## Current Tax\n\nCurrent tax is determined as the amount of tax payable in respect of taxable income for the period. Taxable profit differs from 'profit before tax' as reported in the statement of profit and loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.\n\nThe amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\n## Deferred Tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the group's financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit and quantified using the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted as on the Balance Sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences at the reporting date between", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 458, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

At each Balance Sheet date, foreign currency monetary items are reported using the closing rate. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transactions. Exchange differences that arise on settlement of monetary items or on reporting of monetary items at each Balance Sheet date are recognised in the Statement of Profit \\& Loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n## - Cash and cash equivalent\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash, cheque in hand, cash at banks and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. For this purpose, the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities representing present obligation and they are measured at their acquisition date fair values irrespective of the fact that outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:\n\n1. deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with Ind AS 12 Income Taxes and Ind AS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;\n2. liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with Ind AS 102 Share-based Payments at the acquisition date; and\n\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 459, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "conditions as at the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\n\nIn case of bargain purchase, before recognising gain in respect thereof, the Group determines whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase. Thereafter, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that reassessment. The Group then reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts that Ind AS requires for the purposes of calculating the bargain purchase. If the gain remains after this reassessment and review, the Group recognises it in other comprehensive income and accumulates the same in equity as capital reserve. This gain is attributed to the acquirer. If there does not exist clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase, the Group recognises the gain, after reassessing and reviewing, directly in equity as capital reserve.\n\nNon-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity's net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests' proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Other types of noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in another Ind AS. When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date when the Group obtains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the financial year, the provisional amounts for which the accounting is incomplete shall be disclosed in the financial statements and provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date shall be retrospectively adjusted during the measurement period. During the measurement period, the group shall also recognise additional assets or liabilities if the new information is obtained about the facts and circumstances.\n\n# - Earnings per share \n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year and equity shares to be issued on conversion of mandatorily convertible instruments. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period and for all periods presented is adjusted for events such as bonus issue; bonus element in a rights issue to existing shareholders; share split; and reverse share split (consolidation of shares) that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources.\nFor the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.\n\n## - Cash flow statement\n\nCash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby the net profit/ (loss) before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments. The cash flows from regular revenue generating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement comprise cash, cheque in hand, cash at banks and bank deposits with original maturity of three months or less.\n\n## CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThere have been no changes in our accounting policies during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, and during the Fiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022.", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 460, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# INFORMATION ABOUT REVENUE SPLIT BY GEOGRAPHICAL AREA \n\nThe following information discloses revenue from external customers based on geographical areas:\n\n| Period | Geography | External Revenue |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Three months ended June 30, 2024 | India | 892.00 |\n|  | Outside India | 48.91 |\n|  | Total | 940.91 |\n| Three months ended June 30, 2023 | India | 680.14 |\n|  | Outside India | 25.25 |\n|  | Total | 705.39 |\n| Fiscal 2024 | India | 6,376.15 |\n|  | Outside India | 207.77 |\n|  | Total | 6,583.92 |\n| Fiscal 2023 | India | 4,925.69 |\n|  | Outside India | 271.17 |\n|  | Total | 5,196.86 |\n| Fiscal 2022 | India | 4,553.91 |\n|  | Outside India | 413.42 |\n|  | Total | 4,967.34 |\n\n## KEY COMPONENTS OF INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\nWe report our income and expenditure in the following manner:\n\n## Total income\n\nOur total income comprises our revenue from operations, other income and impairment gain on financial assets.\nRevenue from operations.

For further details, see \"Risk Factors\" on page 44 .\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk refers to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: (i) foreign currency risk, (ii) interest rate risk, and (iii) price risk. The Group's exposure to market risk is on account of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. For further information, see \"Restated Consolidated Financial Information - Note 56 - Risk Management Framework (A) Market Risk\" on page 426.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms and obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of the customer on continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. The financial instruments that are subject to concentration of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables and cash and bank equivalents. For further information, see \"Restated Consolidated Financial Information - Note 56 - Risk Management Framework - (B) Credit Risk\" on page 429.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations without incurring unacceptable losses. The Group's objective is to maintain optimum levels of liquidity and to ensure that funds are available for use as per requirement. The liquidity risk principally arises from obligations on account of financial liabilities viz. borrowings, trade payables and other financial liabilities. The corporate finance department of the Group is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. For further information, see \"Restated Consolidated Financial Information - Note 56 - Risk Management Framework - (C) Liquidity Risk\" on page 433.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe currency risk refers to the exchange rate risk, arising from the change in price of one currency in relation to another. We are not exposed to foreign currency transactions, hence there is no associated currency risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Our exposure to the risk of changes in the market interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates. Our Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk as at the respective reporting dates.\n\n## AUDITOR QUALIFICATIONS AND EMPHASIS OF MATTER\n\nExcept as disclosed in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information, there are no reservations, qualifications,", "metadata": {"source": "drhp.pdf", "page": 471, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "adverse remarks and matters of emphasis included in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information.\n\n# UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENT EVENTS OR TRANSACTIONS \n\nThere have been no unusual or infrequent events or transactions that have in the past or may in the future affect our business operations or future financial performance.\n\n## KNOWN TRENDS OR UNCERTAINTIES\n\nOur business has been subject to significant economic changes arising from the trends identified above in \"Significant Factors Affecting our Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\" above and the uncertainties described in \"Risk Factors\" on page 44.

Pursuant to the UPI Circulars, UPI has been introduced in a phased manner as a payment mechanism (in addition to mechanism of blocking funds in the account maintained with SCSBs under the ASBA) for applications by UPI Bidders through Designated Intermediaries with the objective to reduce the time duration from public issue closure to listing from six Working Days to up to three Working Days. Considering the time required for making necessary changes to the systems and to ensure complete and smooth transition to the UPI payment mechanism, the UPI Circulars have introduced and implemented the UPI payment mechanism in three phases in the following manner:\n(a) Phase I: This phase was applicable from January 1, 2019 until March 31, 2019 or floating of five main board public issues, whichever was later. Subsequently, the timeline for implementation of Phase I was extended until June 30, 2019. Under this phase, an RIB also had the option to submit the ASBA Form with any of the Designated Intermediaries and use his / her UPI ID for the purpose of blocking of funds. The time duration from public issue closure to listing would continue to be six Working Days.\n(b) Phase II: This phase was applicable from July 1, 2019 and was to initially continue for a period of three months or floating of five main board public issues, whichever is later. SEBI vide its circular bearing number SEBI/HO/CFD/DCR2/CIR/P/2019/133 dated November 8, 2019 had extended the timeline for implementation of UPI Phase II till March 31, 2020. Further, pursuant to SEBI circular dated March 30, 2020, this phase was extended till further notice. Under this phase, submission of the ASBA Form without UPI by RIBs through Designated Intermediaries (other than SCSBs) to SCSBs for blocking of funds was discontinued and replaced by the UPI Mechanism. However, the time duration from public issue closure to listing continued to be six Working Days during this phase.\n(c) Phase III: This phase has become applicable on a voluntary basis for all issues opening on or after September 1, 2023 and on a mandatory basis for all issues opening on or after December 1, 2023 vide SEBI circular bearing number SEBI/HO/CFD/TPD1/CIR/P/2023/140 dated August 9, 2023 (\"T+3 Notification\"). In this phase, the time duration from public issue closure to listing has been reduced to three Working Days. The Offer shall be undertaken pursuant to the processes and procedures as notified in the T+3 Notification as applicable, subject to any circulars, clarification or notification issued by SEBI from time to time, including any circular, clarification or notification which may be issued by SEBI.\n\nThe Offer is being made under Phase III of the UPI Circulars (on a mandatory basis) in accordance with the SEBI ICDR Master Circular and the T+3 Notification (to the extent not rescinded by the SEBI ICDR Master Circular in relation to the SEBI ICDR Regulations).\n\nPursuant to the UPI Circulars, SEBI has set out specific requirements for redressal of investor grievances for applications that have been made through the UPI Mechanism. The requirements of the UPI Circulars include, appointment of a nodal officer by the SCSB and submission of their details to SEBI, the requirement for SCSBs to send SMS alerts for the blocking and unblocking of UPI mandates, the requirement for the Registrar to submit details of cancelled, withdrawn or deleted applications and the requirement for the bank accounts of unsuccessful Bidders to be unblocked no later than one day from the date on which the Basis of Allotment is finalised. Failure to unblock the accounts within the timeline would result in the SCSBs being penalised under the relevant securities law.
