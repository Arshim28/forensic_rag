In addition to this, the company's comfortable leverage position and strong liquidity continues to benefit the rating. However, the rating remains constrained by elongating working capital cycle.\n\n## Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions Positive factors\n\n- Significantly improving total operating income (TOI) above \u20b9800.00 crore and sustainability of the same.\n- Maintaining the profitability above $22 \\%$ on sustained basis.\n\n\n## Negative factors\n\n- Deteriorating profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation and tax (PBILDT) margin below 15\\% on a sustained basis.\n- Adjusted overall gearing above 0.75 x on sustained basis.\n- Deteriorating liquidity profile of the company.\n\n\n## Analytical approach: Consolidated\n\nConsolidated approach has been adopted as the subsidiaries are in the same line of business. The list of subsidiaries is as under is presented in Annexure-6.\n\n## Outlook: Stable\n\nThe stable outlook reflects SFC's strong market position, its long track record of operation, positive industry sentiments in waste management practices driven by government initiatives and the company's healthy order book position.\n\n## Detailed description of the key rating drivers:\n\n## Key strengths\n\n## Continuance of growth momentum in near to medium term:\n\nIncreasing demand of water in industrial sector, government's focus on wastewater treatment practices, its initiatives in addressing the environment pollution and the overall lower sewage treatment capacities against higher generation of sewage, all these are expected to increase the business opportunities in this market and benefit the company in terms of topline in the medium term to long-term. The company's healthy order book position reflects the increasing thrust by the government on wastewater treatment practices, which is expected to continue driving its topline in FY24 as well. Apart from providing the water technology (C-tech) and associated ancillary services, the company also sells related equipment/parts related to this technology.

The company books majority of its revenue, i.e. more than $60 \\%$ of the annual revenue in last two quarters of each financial year. On consolidated level, in FY23, the company grew by 5\\% with total income from operations at \u20b9520.80 crore (FY22: \u20b9498.09 crore). The major revenue contributor continues to be C -tech technology segment followed by equipment sale and solid waste segment.\n\n# Continuance of healthy operating margin: \n\nGiven the company's strong market position, growing ratio of in-house manufacturing of equipment and the strategy to lower its dependence on overall imports, the company's operating margin is expected to improve in upcoming years. The company's operating margin continues to remain healthy above $22 \\%$ and the same has also benefitted from the reduction in share of imports in overall procurement to around $40 \\%$ from $60 \\%$ of last year. The company is planning to further reduce its import ratio and to achieve this target, the company has recently set up subsidiary and associates, which are into manufacturing of the equipment which find usage in the C-tech technology. The said companies are into nascent stage of operations; however, CARE Ratings believes that this backward integration will benefit the company's profitability in long-term. On consolidated level, the operating margin of the company improved to $24.01 \\%$ in FY23 (FY22: 22.25\\%). As per 9MFY24 standalone numbers, the operating margin stood at $23.75 \\%$.\n\n## Continuance of healthy order book with reputed clientele:\n\nThe company has healthy order book of \u20b9706.10 crore as on March 04, 2024, thus providing revenue visibility for the medium term. The company, which is already into solid waste business, has taken steps to further augment revenues in this segment by bidding for new orders in the solid waste treatment projects. In addition to this, CARE Ratings expects the company's plan to diversify in agro waste to energy business, is going to support its diversification plan. The customer profile of the company continues to include reputed and high credit worthy infrastructure companies.\n\n## Comfortable debt structure:\n\nThe debt structure is expected to be remain comfortable owing to low leveraged position of the company and y-o-y accruals strengthening the net worth of the company. The debt profile of the company comprises majorly of working capital facility followed by customer advances, term loan, lease liability and loan from directors. As per the management of the company, the capital expenditure (capex) plan, as well as tentative investment in the new projects, will be funded by internal accruals given healthy gross cash accruals generated by the company. The overall gearing of the company stood below unity at 0.28 x as on March 31, 2023 (as on March 31, 0.30x). Due to healthy absolute earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), the interest coverage continues to remain strong in FY23 at 29.76x (FY22:23.42x). As per 9MFY24 standalone numbers, interest coverage stood at 12.71 x .\n\n## Key weaknesses\n\n## Elongated working capital cycle:\n\nThe operations of the company are inherently working capital intensive on account of elongated credit period offered to the customers. The average collection period in FY23 has deteriorated to 111 days (FY22: 76 days). The clients are mainly private sector companies that have long standing relationships with SFC. As per the management, the higher operating cycle is inherent to the nature of business undertaken and accordingly the cost related to such credit period offered is factored in the contract price. Though the collection period is stretched, the credit risk is minimised as most of the debtors are backed by letter of credit. Also, the long credit period is on account of long usance periods given to the customers in letter of credit. As per the debtors ageing schedule, as on December 31, 2023, more than $40 \\%$ are under receivables for more than six months.\n\n## Liquidity: Strong\n\nThe liquidity of the company continues to remain strong with gross cash accrual expected to remain healthy in upcoming years above \u20b990.00 crore annually given the expected improvement in performance. The gross cash accrual of the company in FY23 stood at \u20b999.94 crore (FY22: \u20b993.08 crore). In addition to this, the company has free bank balance of \u20b9164.00 crores as on March 04, 2024, in the form of fixed deposit. The company utilises this to avail overdraft facility in case of any requirement. The cash and bank balance of the company stood at \u20b9109.97 crore as on March 31, 2023. The average maximum utilisation of fund-based limit remains comfortable at around $12 \\%$ and non-fund-based limits at around 39\\% for last 12 months ended January 31, 2024. Against all these sources, the company has total principal debt obligation of only \u20b91.43 crore annually in FY25 \\& FY26.", "metadata": {"source": "rating_report.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "# Applicable criteria \n\nConsolidation\nDefinition of Default\nLiquidity Analysis of Non-financial sector entities\nRating Outlook and Rating Watch\nFinancial Ratios - Non financial Sector\nService Sector Companies\nShort Term Instruments\n\n## About the company and industry\n\nIndustry classification\n\n| Macro-economic <br> Indicator | Sector | Industry | Basic Industry |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Utilities | Utilities | Other utilities | Waste management |\n\nBased in India, SFC is a global water and waste-water group of companies that has its offices located in India, Austria, Poland, Vietnam, Czech Republic, Egypt and China and has a worldwide sales representative network.
