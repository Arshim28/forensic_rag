FY24 revenues grew $27 \\%$ to Rs. 658 Cr from Rs. 520 Cr in FY23 attributed by growing order book in line with growing business opportunities in this relatively untapped sector. WWT Order book as at Sep'24 stood at Rs. 631 Cr providing comfort on revenue visibility over the next 12-15 months. Increasing government initiatives and overall lower treatment capacities against higher volume of sewage \\& waste generation are expected to provide SFC ample opportunities to grow revenues in the medium to long-term.\n- WWT contributes $\\sim 60-85 \\%$ of consolidated revenues, balance $15-20 \\%$ comes from the SWT segment \\& other operating revenues. Segmentwise revenues are as below:\n| Revenue Epit | FY22 |  | FY23 |  | FY24 |  | Q1 FY25 |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Rs. Cr | \\% | Rs.

Wastewater Treatment Industry (WWT)\nMaintained a CAGR of $5.5 \\%$ over the last 5 years; expected to accelerate to $9.6 \\%$ growth in the next 5 years.\n\n- Total WWT Market in Rs. 250 Bn (dunctated into the following:\ni. Municipal Segment Rs. 167 bn - Municipal water Rs. 60 bn + Municipal wastewater Rs. 107 bn\nii. Industrial Segment Rs. 83 bn - Industrial water Rs. 46 bn + Industrial wastewater / effluents Rs. 38 bn", "metadata": {"source": "mosaic_note.pdf", "page": 4, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n5. Solid Waste Management / Treatment (SWM)\n\n- Waste Generation 62 million tons p.a. $\\rightarrow$ Waste Collection 43 million tons p.a. ( $\\sim 69 \\%$ ) $\\rightarrow$ Waste Treatment 12 million tons p.a. i.e. $\\sim 30 \\%$ of waste generated in India annually.\n- Total estimated energy generation potential from urban \\& industrial solid organic waste in India is $\\sim 5690$ MW.\nb. PROFITABILITY\n\nEBIDTA margins have improved y-o-y. Over the last 3 fiscals, margins have improved from $21 \\%$ in FY23 to $29 \\%$ in FY24. This is due to lower import purchases along with growing revenues. SFC has a strong market position in the SBR segment ( $80 \\%$ market share). The company's strategy to lower dependency on imports has led to setting up of subsidiaries / associate entities in India which will manufacture key components that find usage in C-Tech for wastewater treatment. This backward integration is expected to benefit SFC's profitability in the long-term as well.\nc. NET FIXED ASSETS\n\n- Increase in NFA from Rs 60 Cr in FY23 to Rs 98 Cr in FY24 is attributed to acquisition of subsidiary, Hindustan Waste Treatment Pvt Ltd. During FYY24, SFC increased stake in HWTRt, from $49 \\%$ to $80 \\%$.\n\n\n# d. LEVERAGE \n\n- SFC's total bank debt o/s as at FY24 stood at Rs. 131 Cr (TL + FB WCOL) which increased from previous fiscal's o/s Rs. 46 Cr .\n- Increase in TL o/s during FY24 - In Dec'23, SFC's subsidiary entity, Vasudha Waste Treatment Pvt Ltd, availed term loans from Avia Bank aggregating to Rs. 62 Cr (o/s in Sep'24 Rs. 56 Cr ) which were utilised to repay the unsecured loans + accrued interest extended by SFC for SWM business operations.\n- Working capital limits o/s in FY24 Rs. 85 Cr increased from FY23 in line with growth in the business.\n- Consolidated network stood at Rs. 561 Cr as at FY24 - comfortable capital structure with Debt / NW at 0.23x.\n- Improving EBIDTA margins has led to comfortable leverage position - FY24 Debt / EBIDTA stood at 0.68x. Q1 FY25 Debt / EBIDTA is high at 2.33x due to the seasonal nature of billings \\& revenue recognition as mentioned earlier. The same is expected to correct at the end of FY25.\n\n\n## e. WORKING CAPITAL CYCLE\n\n- As mentioned earlier, $77 \\%$ of SFC's billings is done in the latter half of the year with a bulk of the revenues being recognised only in Q4 of each fiscal.\n- SFC offers elongated credit period to its customers (avg. 6-9 months) which is inherent to the nature of business in this segment, as can be verified for other peers in the industry as well - operations are therefore working capital intensive.\n- Working capital days increased from 131 days in FY23 to 200 days in FY24 primarily due to increase in receivable days. Stretched credit period poses significant threat to the company's ability to collect dues from clients on timely basis. However, it is pertinent to note the following:\n\n1. Out of Rs. 375 Cr of receivables o/s as at FY24, Rs. 45 Cr pertains to recoveries from Goa Municipal Corporation w.r.t SWM plants set up in Goa on annuity model. Total capes incurred by SFC for this project is recoverable annually in piecemeal instalments with bulk of the payments due in FY28-27.\n2.

Strengths \\& Risks - on SFC Environmental Technologies Ltd:\n\n1. Key Strengths:\n\nIncreasing demand for waste management \\& wastewater treatment: rapid urbanization and industrial expansion has led to alarming pollution levels and significant waste management and water treatment challenges. Increasing demand for water in industrial sectors viz. textiles, pharmaceuticals etc., government's focus on wastewater treatment practices, initiatives to address growing environmental pollution, and most importantly, lesser sewage treatment capacities against high generation of waste / effluents ( $\\sim 64 \\%$ of sewage generated in India goes untreated, as per Frost \\& Sullivan Industry analysis report) have given rise to business opportunities in this segment. SFC is expected to benefit from this demand-supply disparity in terms of revenue growth in the medium to long term.\n\n- Strong Market Position: having provided C-Tech technology to 1000+ STPs with total installed capacity of 11,900 MLD. SFC holds over $90 \\%$ market share in Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) technology, a key wastewater treatment method in India.\n- Healthy Customer Profile and Order Book: SFC contracts with established and recognised EPC players with good credit profiles viz. Enviro Control Pvt Ltd (CARB A+), GVPR Engineers Ltd (ICRA A+), Vidivana; Environment Pvt Ltd (CRISS, A); SMC Infrastructures Pvt Ltd (IVR A), Khlari Infrastructure Pvt Ltd (CARB BBB+) etc. to name a few. Top 10 customers contribute $\\sim 60$ $70 \\%$ of overall revenues. Additionally, $80 \\%+$ revenues come from repeat orders. As at September 2024, SFC had an order book of Rs. 631 Cr expected to be recognised over the next 12-18 months.\n- Healthy Margins: SFC has been consistently generating operating margins upwards of $20 \\%$ over the last 3 fiscals due to lower import purchases along with strong market position in the SBR segment. The company's strategy to lower dependency on imports", "metadata": {"source": "mosaic_note.pdf", "page": 8, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "has led to setting up of subsidiaries / associate entities which will manufacture key components that find usage in C-Tech for wastewater treatment. This backward integration is expected to benefit SFC's profitability in the long-term.\nComfortable Leverage \\& Strong Liquidity: As at FY24, SFC's standalone network stood at Rs. 513 Cr (y -n-y accruals strengthening reserves of the company) and standalone EBIOTA Rs. 172 Cr. Against this, debt stood at Rs. 76 Cr comprising majority of working capital limits. Debt / Equity and Debt / EBIOTA remains comfortable at less than 0.50x. Additionally, SFC had gross cash accruals and liquid investments (in the form of FOs) of Rs. 142 Cr and Rs. 165 Cr respectively. These sources are sufficient to service debt obligations over the next 2 fiscals.\n\n# 2. Key Risk Factors: \n\n- Elongated Working Capital Cycle: Standalone working capital days increased from 120 days in FY23 to 168 days in FY24 majority attributed by deterioration in receivable days from 158 days in FY23 to 200 days in FY24. SFC provides elongated credit period to its customers (avg. in the range of 6-9 months). Stretched receivable days are inherent to the nature of the business but the risk is minimised to some extent as $50 \\%$ of receivables are backed by LCs.\n- Significant dependence on few customers: SFC's target customers in WWT are EPC companies ultimately serving municipalities and government agencies. Top 10 customers contributed to $63 \\%$ of revenues as at Q1 FY25. Contracts with these customers are short-lem ( 12 months), business is usually conducted by way of purchase orders and / or letters of intent. Any failure to retain / negotiate and execute contracts with any of the top 10 customers could adversely affect business \\& revenues.\n- Transition into Solid Waste Management (ability to manage scale in this segment): As on date, $85 \\%$ of consolidated revenues are derived from the Wastewater Treatment segment, $15 \\%$ from Solid Waste Management. SFC is now looking to increase focus on the Solid Waste Management segment and are L1 bidders for Project in Chandigarh ( $1-750$ TPA) that is estimated to cost -Rs. 500 Cr ( $70 \\%$ to be funded through debt). Ability to raise funds and manage scalability of larger projects is a key risk considering that SFC may not have the expertise in the SWM segment. The existing North \\& South Goa SWM Plants are relatively smaller in size ( $1-350$ TPA). Further, the SWM segment will require significant amount of capes to be undertaken through a combination of debt and internal accruals. Consequently, large amounts of debt raised can also adversely affect current leverage ratios.\n- Shift to focus on SWM segment will lead to inflation of Balance Sheet - this segment requires significant capes which is expected to be funded out of debt and internal accruals. Increasing leverage will adversely impact SFC's financial profile \\& cash flows.\n\n\n## Performance Guarantee / Retention Money\n\nCivil Litigation against Austrian Subsidiary, SFC Umwelt Technik GmbH, amounting to Rs. 32 Cr - pertains to a Portuguese project where SFC Umwelt Technik GmbH was a tech partner. As explained to us, there were some faults / errors made by the contractors, but SFC was also wrongly made party to the claim. Company does not see any liability arising from this.\n\nDelay in SFC's IPO: Investment (proposed transaction as tabled Section VI) is proposed to be redeemed through IPO proceeds or refinance in case the IPO doesn't happen during this period. The IPO is envisaged to be completed in the next 10-12 months (i.e. by March 2026). In the event the same does not happen / gets delayed, the following mitigants are in place.\na. DSRA of 3 months' ensuing Principal + Interest Obligations will be lien marked in favour of Debenture Holders (-Rs.2.5 Cr)\nb. As at March 2028, $25 \\%$ of the NCDs are expected to be repaid from internal accruals\nc. Transaction is backed by strong security: 1) 1.25x cover on shares held by Issuer (ATPL) in SFC pledged (5.33\\% stake valued at -Rs. 160 Cr); 2) NDU on Promoter's Liquid Investments -Rs. 17 Cr; 3) Mortgage on residential bungalow in Mumbai valued at Rs. 20 Cr ; 4) ISRA Rs. 1.25 Cr has been created and lien marked.\n\n## VII. Risks and Mitigants of Proposed Transaction\n\n| Sr. N | Risks | Mitigants |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 1 | Exit is dependent on SFC's IPO | SFC's IPO is envisaged to be completed by March 2026. In case of delays, the following mitigants and alternatives are in place: <br> a. Promoter's liquid investments -Rs. 16 Cr can be utilised for part repayment. <br> b. ISRA Rs. 1.25 Cr and DSRA -Rs. 2 Cr can be utilised <br> c. Consistent revenue \\& EBIOTA; low group leverage (Debt / EBIOTA at 0.7x and Net Debt / EBIOTA at -0.3x) and Real Estate assets as collateral makes refinance an attractive alternative exit mechanism. <br> d. By March 2028, $\\sim 25 \\%$ of the proposed investment is expected to be repaid from internal group accruals. <br> e. SFC's internal accruals \\& cash balances are comfortable to support debt serviceability as long as there is healthy order book and no additional term borrowings. |\n| 2 | Variation in Current Valuation -Rs. 700 Cr vs estimated IPO Valuation of SFC Environmental Technologies -Rs. 3500 Cr | ATPL's acquisition of $5.53 \\%$ stake in SFC occurred at an EV of -Rs. 700 Cr in February 2024 (End use of existing Investment). <br> As per Gaurav Jain's (IBBI registered value) report dated 5th Sep 2024, SFC's valuation is -Rs. 3600 Cr (based on Comparable Companies' Multiplex Method discounted by $40 \\%$ to consider SFC's smaller scale of business as compared to peers). |", "metadata": {"source": "mosaic_note.pdf", "page": 9, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "|  |  | Even if we discount the Multiplex by $40 \\%$, min. valuation is expected to be $\\sim R \\times 3000 \\mathrm{Cr}$ giving adequate security cover of $3.55 x$ (value of $5.33 \\%$ shares pledged against NCD o's of Rs. 45 Cr ). <br> Industry Peers PE Multipie is at in 30-35 range. Discounted PE Multipie for SFC ( $40 \\%$ discount) is 21 against PAT Rs. 144 Cr resulting in Equity Value of Rs. 3050 Cr . |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 3 | Security Enforcement Risks | Enforcement of share pledge is the faded route considering: <br> - Large external investor in the company, should be amenable to buy additional stake. <br> - Given that SFC has already become public and the shares are in Demat form, there are no legal impediments to share pledge enforcement per se. <br> Other security offered viz. enforcement of mortgage and promoter's guarantee will be more time consuming from a legal and judicial point of view. |\n| 4 | Approvals from existing lenders | SFC's existing lenders' sanctions include templatised / general conditions w.r.t changes in shareholding pattern, management control etc. However, no action has been taken by these lenders for any of the transactions done at Group / Promoter Level previously. Further, the Issuer and Promoters have provided a representation in the Debenture Documents that they have all the necessary approvals in place to do the transaction. |\n| 5 | Keyman Risk | SFC's day to day business operations are entirely managed and controlled by Mr. Sandeep Asidkar (Promoter, Guarantor). Keyman Risk is mitigated in the following manner: <br> - Mr. Sandeep's daughter, Prachiti Asidkar, is part of the business and is gradually expected to take over key decision-making responsibilities. <br> - Keyman Insurance policy of Mr. Sandeep Asidkar is endorsed in favour of the Debenture Trustee. |\n| 6 | No covenants in DSA w.r.t Debt Cap at Promoter Level |  |\n| 7 | No covenants in DSA w.r.t capex restrictions on SFC | SFC's Solid Waste Management business is expected to incur significant capex. Uproming Chandigarh Project Rs. 500 Cr. However, it is pertinent to note the following: <br> 1. Uproming SWM Projects also have government / municipal body aid in the form of Viability Gap Fundings / Grants. <br> 2. Existing SWM projects are based on Annuity Models where capex amount incurred has been recovered from the government counter party in annual instalments over a period of time, thereby easing financial burden. |\n| 8 | No specific covenant in the DSA about the OFS portion of IPO | Pledge removal will be subject to details regarding OFS shares at the time of RHP filing. |\n| 9 | Share pledge will have to be removed before the RHP filing | Will have to build suitable escrow mechanism at that time to ensure that the OFS proceeds are used for our debt servicing. |\n| 10 | All Investment Decisions to be approved by Majority Debenture Holders (holding min $75 \\%$ of the NCDs) | Will have to develop a working relationship with Oxyzo Financial Services to mitigate this. |\n\n# IX.
